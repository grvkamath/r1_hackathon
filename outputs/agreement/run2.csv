8,has,have,0,"Immediately to the north, the state highway has a partial interchange with i-395 (henry g.","Immediately to the north, the state highway have a partial interchange with i-395 (henry g.",15,9,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are almost identical except for the verb: ""has"" in Sentence A and ""have"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""the state highway."" Since ""highway"" is singular, the verb should agree with a singular subject. ""Has"" is the third person singular form of the verb ""to have,"" while ""have"" is used with plural subjects or first/second person.

So, Sentence A uses ""has,"" which is correct for a singular subject. Sentence B uses ""have,"" which would be incorrect here. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical. 

Wait, but maybe there's something else I'm missing. Let me double-check. The structure of the sentence is: ""the state highway [has/have] a partial interchange..."" The subject is definitely singular, so ""has"" is right. The rest of the sentence seems okay. The part in parentheses is a name, but it's lowercase and has a period after ""g."" which might be a typo, but the user is focusing on the verb agreement. So yes, the main issue is the verb. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes collective nouns can take plural verbs, but ""state highway"" isn't a collective noun. It's a singular entity. So no, ""have"" doesn't work here. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect due to subject-verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- **Sentence A** uses the correct singular verb **""has""** to agree with the singular subject **""the state highway""**.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses the plural verb **""have""**, which does not match the singular subject.  

**Note:** Both sentences have minor formatting issues (e.g., lowercase ""i"" in ""i-395"" and the incomplete name ""(henry g.""), but the critical grammatical error in Sentence B is the subject-verb disagreement."
8,has,have,0,"Immediately to the north, the state highway has a partial interchange with i-395 (henry g.","Immediately to the north, the state highway have a partial interchange with i-395 (henry g.",15,9,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Both start the same way: ""Immediately to the north, the state highway..."" Then they differ in the verb and some other parts.

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""the state highway."" Since ""highway"" is singular, the verb should agree with a singular subject. In sentence A, the verb is ""have,"" which is plural. That's a problem because ""highway"" is singular. So ""have"" should be ""has."" 

Looking at sentence B, the verb is ""has,"" which matches the singular subject. That makes sense. So sentence B is correct in terms of subject-verb agreement. 

Next, looking at the rest of the sentences. Both end with ""(henry g."" That seems like an incomplete reference or a citation. The lowercase ""i"" in ""i-395"" is incorrect because interstate highways are usually capitalized, like ""I-395."" Also, ""henry g."" is probably a person's name, but it's not properly closed with a parenthesis and the sentence ends abruptly. Both sentences have this issue, so they're both incomplete or have formatting errors. But the main question is about grammaticality, which primarily concerns the verb agreement here. 

So, the key difference is ""have"" vs. ""has."" Since the subject is singular, ""has"" is correct. Therefore, sentence B is grammatical, and sentence A is ungrammatical. The other issues with capitalization and the incomplete parenthetical are additional errors, but they're present in both sentences. The user's main focus is on the grammaticality between A and B, so the verb agreement is the deciding factor.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence B** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject ""the state highway"" is singular, so the verb must agree with it. Sentence A incorrectly uses the plural verb ""have"" (*""the state highway have""*), while Sentence B correctly uses the singular verb ""has"" (*""the state highway has""*).  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Both sentences have formatting issues (e.g., lowercase ""i"" in ""i-395"" should be ""I-395"", and the incomplete parenthetical ""(henry g."" lacks proper punctuation and closure). However, these errors do not affect the core grammaticality of the sentences."

Okay, let's see. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are almost identical except for the verb form after ""references."" Sentence A uses ""exist"" and Sentence B uses ""exists."" 

First, I need to recall subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""references,"" which is plural. The verb should agree with the subject in number. ""References"" is plural, so the verb should be plural as well. The plural form of the verb ""to exist"" is ""exist."" So in Sentence A, ""references exist"" is correct. Sentence B uses ""exists,"" which is singular, so that would be incorrect.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with collective nouns or when the subject is separated from the verb. But in this case, ""references"" is clearly plural. There's no intervening phrase that would make it tricky. So ""exist"" is definitely the right choice here. 

Let me double-check. If the subject were singular, like ""a reference,"" then ""exists"" would be correct. But since it's ""references,"" plural, ""exist"" is correct. So Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject ""references"" is plural, so the verb must agree in number. ""Exist"" (plural) is correct in Sentence A, while ""exists"" (singular) in Sentence B creates a subject-verb agreement error.  

**Note:** Both sentences have other stylistic or punctuation issues (e.g., inconsistent quotation marks, missing context for ""dmb""), but the key grammatical distinction lies in ""exist"" vs. ""exists."""
6,exist,exists,0,"Also, note that sometimes references exist, but do nothing other than verify ""at local stadium x, dmb played (review concert).","Also, note that sometimes references exists, but do nothing other than verify ""at local stadium x, dmb played (review concert).",20,186,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are almost identical except for the verb ""exists"" in Sentence A and ""exist"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""references."" Since ""references"" is plural, the verb should agree with it. The verb in question is ""exists"" vs. ""exist."" ""Exists"" is singular, and ""exist"" is plural.

So, ""references exist"" would be correct because ""references"" is plural. Therefore, Sentence B uses the correct plural form ""exist,"" making it grammatical. Sentence A uses ""exists,"" which is singular, so it doesn't agree with the plural subject ""references."" That makes Sentence A ungrammatical.

Wait, let me double-check. The sentence structure is ""Also, note that sometimes references [exist/exists], but do nothing other than..."" The main clause is ""references exist,"" and then there's a conjunction ""but"" followed by another verb phrase ""do nothing..."" The subject ""references"" is definitely plural, so the verb should be ""exist."" Yes, that's right. So Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject ""references"" is plural, so the verb must agree in number.  
- **Sentence A** uses *""exists""* (singular), which incorrectly pairs with the plural subject ""references.""  
- **Sentence B** uses *""exist""* (plural), which matches the plural subject ""references.""  

**Corrected Sentence B:**  
*Also, note that sometimes references exist, but do nothing other than verify ""at local stadium x, dmb played"" (review concert).*  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement (""references exist"" ✔️ vs. ""references exists"" ❌)."
3,features,feature,0,"The book also features the characters of gideon beech, a fictionalised george bernard shaw, and (briefly) john cleavis, a fictionalised c.","The book also feature the characters of gideon beech, a fictionalised george bernard shaw, and (briefly) john cleavis, a fictionalised c.",21,811,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are almost identical except for the verb following ""book also."" Sentence A uses ""features"" and Sentence B uses ""feature.""

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""the book,"" which is singular. In the present tense, singular subjects take verbs with an 's' at the end. So ""the book features"" would be correct because ""features"" is the third-person singular form. ""Feature"" without the 's' is the base form, used with plural subjects like ""books feature.""

Looking at Sentence A: ""The book also features..."" – that's correct because ""book"" is singular. Sentence B: ""The book also feature..."" – here, ""feature"" doesn't agree with the singular subject. So B is incorrect.

I should also check if there's any other part of the sentences that might affect this. The rest of the sentences are the same, listing characters. No other verbs seem to be an issue. The parentheses around ""briefly"" don't affect the subject-verb agreement. So the main issue is definitely the verb form after ""book also.""

Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical due to the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""the book"" (singular), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A correctly uses **""features""** (third-person singular).  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""feature""** (plural or base form), which does not agree with the singular subject.  

The error in Sentence B is a **subject-verb agreement mistake**."
3,features,feature,0,"The book also features the characters of gideon beech, a fictionalised george bernard shaw, and (briefly) john cleavis, a fictionalised c.","The book also feature the characters of gideon beech, a fictionalised george bernard shaw, and (briefly) john cleavis, a fictionalised c.",21,811,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are very similar, so I need to look closely at the differences.

First, I'll read both sentences again carefully. 

Sentence A: ""The book also feature the characters of gideon beech..."" 
Sentence B: ""The book also features the characters of gideon beech...""

The main difference I notice is the verb ""feature"" in Sentence A versus ""features"" in Sentence B. The subject of the sentence is ""The book,"" which is singular. In English, the verb must agree with the subject in number. So, a singular subject takes a singular verb form. 

The base form of the verb is ""feature,"" and the third person singular present tense is ""features."" Since ""the book"" is third person singular, the correct verb form should be ""features."" Therefore, Sentence B uses the correct verb form, while Sentence A uses ""feature,"" which doesn't agree with the singular subject. 

Additionally, I should check other parts of the sentences for any issues. Both sentences list characters with lowercase names, which might be a stylistic choice, but proper nouns like ""George Bernard Shaw"" and ""C."" (possibly referring to a person's initial) should be capitalized. However, the user's main focus is on the grammaticality between A and B, so the primary issue is subject-verb agreement. 

So, Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the verb form, and Sentence B is correct. I should also mention the capitalization as a minor point, but since the question is about grammaticality, the verb agreement is the key factor here.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""the book"" (singular), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses ""feature"" (plural verb form) with a singular subject.  
- Sentence B correctly uses ""features"" (singular verb form).  

**Minor Notes:**  
- Proper nouns like ""George Bernard Shaw"" and ""C."" (likely ""C. S. Lewis"" or similar) should be capitalized.  
- The sentence structure and punctuation are otherwise identical and acceptable.  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement (""book features"" ✔️ vs. ""book feature"" ❌)."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both very similar except for the verb ""remain"" vs. ""remains."" 

First, I need to identify the subject of the verb. The subject in both sentences is ""The see-write and hear-say conditions."" Since there are two conditions connected by ""and,"" the subject is plural.

In English, plural subjects take plural verbs. So the correct verb form should be ""remain"" without the ""s."" Sentence A uses ""remain,"" which is correct. Sentence B uses ""remains,"" which is singular, so that's incorrect. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes compound subjects can be tricky. If the subject were singular, like ""each condition,"" then ""remains"" would be right. But here, it's two conditions combined with ""and,"" making it plural. So yes, ""remain"" is correct. 

Also, looking at the second verb in both sentences: ""do not require."" That's plural, matching the plural subject. If the subject were singular, it would be ""does not require."" But since both sentences use ""do,"" which is correct for plural, that part is okay. 

So the error in Sentence B is only in the first verb ""remains."" Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical. **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb ""remain/remains"" is ""The see-write and hear-say conditions,"" which is plural (two conditions joined by ""and""). A plural subject requires a plural verb (""**remain**"").  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses ""remain"" (plural verb).  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses ""remains"" (singular verb), which does not agree with the plural subject.  

The second verb (""do not require"") is correctly plural in both sentences, matching the plural subject. The error in Sentence B is isolated to the first verb (""remains"")."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. Both look pretty similar, but there's a difference in the verb forms. 

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""The see-write and hear-say conditions."" That's a compound subject because it's two things connected by ""and."" So, compound subjects usually take a plural verb. 

Looking at Sentence A: ""remains in the same sensory domain..."" Wait, ""remains"" is singular. The subject is plural, so the verb should be ""remain."" That's a problem. Then the next verb is ""do not require,"" which is plural. So in Sentence A, the first verb is singular, which doesn't agree with the plural subject.

Sentence B uses ""remain"" and ""do not require."" Both verbs are plural, matching the plural subject. That makes sense. So Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect because of the singular ""remains.""

Wait, but maybe there's something else. Let me double-check. The subject is definitely plural. ""Conditions"" is plural, and with ""see-write and hear-say"" as modifiers, the head noun is ""conditions."" So yes, plural. Therefore, ""remain"" is correct. Sentence A is wrong. Sentence B is right.
</think>

**Answer:**  

**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""The see-write and hear-say conditions""* (plural), so the verbs must agree in number.  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses *""remains""* (singular) for the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses *""remain""* (plural), matching the plural subject.  

The second verb *""do not require""* is already plural and correct in both sentences, but the error in *""remains""* makes Sentence A ungrammatical."
3,is,are,0,Beddgelert railway station is a railway station on the narrow gauge welsh highland railway in north wales.,Beddgelert railway station are a railway station on the narrow gauge welsh highland railway in north wales.,17,1195,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both about Beddgelert railway station. The main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs. Here, the subject is ""Beddgelert railway station,"" which is a singular noun phrase. Even though ""station"" is part of the name, the entire name refers to a single station. So the verb should agree with a singular subject.

In Sentence A, the verb is ""is,"" which is singular. That matches the singular subject. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is plural. That doesn't match. So Sentence A should be correct, and B incorrect.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with collective nouns or when the subject has a plural-sounding name. For example, a band name like ""The Beatles"" is singular because it's one band. Similarly, ""Beddgelert railway station"" is one station, so it's singular. Therefore, ""is"" is correct. 

Another thing to check: the rest of the sentence. In both sentences, the predicate is ""a railway station..."" which uses the article ""a,"" indicating singular. So the verb should be singular to agree with both the subject and the predicate. If the predicate were plural, like ""railway stations,"" maybe there's a different consideration, but here it's ""a railway station,"" so ""is"" is needed.

Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject ""Beddgelert railway station"" is singular, so it requires the singular verb **""is""** (Sentence A). Using the plural verb **""are""** (Sentence B) violates subject-verb agreement. Additionally, the predicate ""a railway station"" (singular) reinforces the need for a singular verb.  

**Ungrammaticality in Sentence B:**  
- **""are""** incorrectly matches the singular subject.  
- Example of correct usage: ""The stations **are**..."" (plural subject) vs. ""The station **is**..."" (singular subject)."
3,is,are,0,Beddgelert railway station is a railway station on the narrow gauge welsh highland railway in north wales.,Beddgelert railway station are a railway station on the narrow gauge welsh highland railway in north wales.,17,1195,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about Beddgelert railway station. Let me start by reading both sentences carefully.

Sentence A: ""Beddgelert railway station are a railway station on the narrow gauge welsh highland railway in north wales.""

Sentence B: ""Beddgelert railway station is a railway station on the narrow gauge welsh highland railway in north wales.""

Hmm, the main difference between them is the verb: ""are"" vs. ""is"". The subject here is ""Beddgelert railway station"", which is a singular noun phrase. In English, singular subjects take singular verbs. So ""is"" would be correct here. Using ""are"" would be incorrect because ""are"" is plural. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with collective nouns or when the subject ends with an 's', but in this case, ""railway station"" is clearly singular. Even though ""station"" is part of a larger network, the subject itself is singular. So Sentence B should be correct with ""is"", and Sentence A is wrong with ""are"".

Also, looking at the other parts of the sentences, the rest seems okay. The prepositions ""on"" and ""in"" are correctly used. The adjectives like ""narrow gauge"" and ""welsh highland railway"" are in lowercase here, but proper nouns like ""Welsh Highland Railway"" and ""North Wales"" should be capitalized. But the user's focus is on the verb agreement, so maybe the capitalization isn't the main issue here. But it's worth noting as an additional error, but the primary issue is subject-verb agreement.

So, conclusion: Sentence B is grammatical because it uses ""is"" with a singular subject. Sentence A is ungrammatical because it incorrectly uses ""are"" with a singular subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The subject ""Beddgelert railway station"" is singular, so it requires the singular verb **""is""** (Sentence B). Using **""are""** (Sentence A) is incorrect because ""are"" is plural and does not match the singular subject.  
- **Additional Notes:**  
  - Proper nouns like ""Welsh Highland Railway"" and ""North Wales"" should be capitalized for correctness, but this was not the focus of the question.  
  - The core grammatical error in Sentence A is the mismatch between the singular subject and plural verb.  

**Correct Sentence:**  
*Beddgelert railway station **is** a railway station on the narrow gauge Welsh Highland Railway in North Wales.*"

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both talking about Gisbert being a founding member of Convergence, with some members listed. The difference between them is the verb in the relative clause: ""include"" vs. ""includes"".

First, I need to figure out the subject of the verb in each case. The relative clause starts with ""whose members"", so ""members"" is the subject here. Now, ""members"" is plural, right? So the verb should agree with the plural subject. The verb in question is ""include"". In sentence A, it's ""include"", which is plural. In sentence B, it's ""includes"", which is singular. 

Wait, so if the subject is plural (""members""), the verb should be plural. That would make sentence A correct because ""include"" is the plural form. Sentence B uses ""includes"", which is singular, so that would be incorrect. 

But let me double-check. The structure is ""Convergence, whose members include..."" Here, ""whose"" refers to Convergence, but ""members"" is the actual subject. So the verb needs to agree with ""members"", not ""Convergence"". Since ""members"" is plural, the verb should be ""include"". 

Another way to test this is to rephrase the sentence. If I take the relative clause out: ""The members include Paul Romaine..."" That's correct. If I use ""includes"": ""The members includes..."" That's wrong. So yes, sentence A is correct, B is incorrect because of subject-verb agreement.

I should also check if there's any other possible confusion. For example, maybe someone might think the subject is ""Convergence"", but the relative clause is ""whose members"", so ""members"" is definitely the subject. Therefore, the verb must agree with ""members"".

So conclusion: Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is ungrammatical due to the singular verb ""includes"" with a plural subject ""members"".
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical.  
**Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb in the relative clause (*""whose members...""*) is **""members""** (plural). The verb must agree with the plural subject, so **""include""** (plural) is correct. Sentence B incorrectly uses **""includes""** (singular), violating subject-verb agreement.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Sentence A:** ""include"" ✅ (plural verb matches plural subject ""members"").  
- **Sentence B:** ""includes"" ❌ (singular verb incorrectly paired with plural subject)."

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about Gisbert being a founding member of Convergence, with some details about the members.

First, I need to look at the difference between the two sentences. The main difference I notice is the verb used in the relative clause: Sentence A uses ""includes"" and Sentence B uses ""include"". The subject here is ""whose members"", so I need to check subject-verb agreement.

In Sentence A: ""...whose members includes Paul Romaine..."" The subject is ""members"", which is plural. The verb should agree with a plural subject, so ""include"" would be correct. Using ""includes"" here is incorrect because ""includes"" is singular. So Sentence A has a subject-verb agreement error.

Sentence B: ""...whose members include Paul Romaine..."" Here, ""include"" is plural, matching the plural subject ""members"". That makes this sentence grammatically correct.

Wait, but sometimes collective nouns can be tricky. For example, ""group"" or ""team"" might take a singular verb even though they refer to multiple people. But in this case, the phrase is ""whose members"", and ""members"" is clearly plural. So the verb should definitely be plural. 

Another thing to check is the structure. The relative clause ""whose members include..."" is modifying ""Convergence"". Since ""members"" are individual people, plural is correct. So yes, Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is wrong because of the singular verb with a plural subject.

I should also check if there are any other differences, but the rest of the sentences seem identical. The capitalization of names is correct (Paul Romaine, Jon Gunther), and the structure of the sentence is otherwise fine. So the only issue is the verb agreement in Sentence A.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The key difference lies in subject-verb agreement within the relative clause:  
- **Sentence A** uses *""includes""* (singular verb) with the plural subject *""members""*. This mismatch makes it ungrammatical.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses *""include""* (plural verb) to agree with the plural subject *""members""*.  

**Why this matters:**  
The phrase *""whose members""* refers to multiple individuals (Paul Romaine, Jon Gunther), requiring a plural verb. Collective nouns (e.g., ""group"") might take singular verbs, but *""members""* explicitly pluralizes the subject here.  

**Corrected Example (Sentence B):**  
*Additionally, Gisbert is a founding member of Convergence, whose members include Paul Romaine on drums and Jon Gunther on saxophone.*"

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about Morris's theory and male cats bringing home prey.

First, I need to look at the differences between the two sentences. The main difference is in the verb used after ""male cats also."" Sentence A says ""bring home prey,"" while Sentence B uses ""brings home prey."" 

Hmm, subject-verb agreement is probably the key here. The subject in both cases is ""male cats,"" which is plural. So the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Bring"" is the base form for plural, and ""brings"" is the third person singular. So ""male cats also bring"" would be correct because ""cats"" is plural. Therefore, Sentence B has ""brings,"" which is incorrect because it's singular, while Sentence A uses ""bring,"" which is correct for plural. 

Wait, let me double-check. The structure is ""the fact that male cats also bring home prey."" The clause after ""that"" should have the verb agree with ""male cats."" Yes, ""male cats bring"" is correct. So Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is wrong because it uses ""brings"" with a plural subject. 

Another thing to check is the rest of the sentence. The part after ""despite"" uses ""males having no involvement,"" which is a gerund phrase. That seems okay. No issues there. So the only error is in Sentence B's verb agreement. 

So conclusion: Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the verb form.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The key difference lies in subject-verb agreement. The subject ""male cats"" is plural, so the verb must agree with it.  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""bring""** (plural verb form) to match the plural subject ""male cats.""  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""brings""** (singular verb form), which clashes with the plural subject.  

The error in Sentence B violates the rule of subject-verb agreement, making it ungrammatical. The rest of both sentences (e.g., ""despite males having..."") is structurally sound."

The main difference between them is the verb form after ""male cats"": ""brings"" in Sentence A and ""bring"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""male cats,"" which is plural. The verb should agree with the subject in number. So, plural subjects take plural verbs. ""Brings"" is singular (third person singular present tense), while ""bring"" is plural. Therefore, ""male cats also bring"" should be correct because ""cats"" is plural. That would make Sentence B correct and Sentence A incorrect.

But wait, let me double-check. The structure is ""the fact that male cats also brings/bring home prey."" The clause after ""that"" is a noun clause. The subject of that clause is ""male cats,"" so the verb needs to agree with that. Yes, ""male cats"" is plural, so ""bring"" is correct. So Sentence B is grammatical, and A is not.

Another thing to check: the rest of the sentence. The part after the comma is ""despite males having no involvement..."" That seems okay. ""Males"" is plural, but ""having"" is a gerund, so that's fine. The structure ""despite [noun] having..."" is correct. So the only error is in the verb form in the noun clause. Therefore, Sentence B is correct.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the clause ""male cats also bring home prey"" is the plural noun ""male cats."" The verb must agree in number with the subject, so the plural form **""bring""** (Sentence B) is correct. Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb **""brings""** with the plural subject ""male cats,"" violating subject-verb agreement.  

The rest of both sentences is grammatically sound, including the phrase ""despite males having no involvement with raising kittens,"" which uses a gerund (""having"") appropriately.  

**Key Issue:**  
- ✅ **Sentence B:** ""male cats also **bring**"" (plural subject + plural verb).  
- ❌ **Sentence A:** ""male cats also **brings**"" (plural subject + singular verb)."
2,pays,pay,0,"The traveller pays the vat over goods in the shop, and can request for a refund when exporting the goods.","The traveller pay the vat over goods in the shop, and can request for a refund when exporting the goods.",20,2397,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B.

First, I'll look at Sentence A: ""The traveller pays the vat over goods in the shop, and can request for a refund when exporting the goods."" The subject here is ""the traveller,"" which is third person singular. The verb that follows is ""pays."" In present tense, third person singular verbs typically end with -s, so ""pays"" is correct here. Then there's ""can request,"" which uses the modal verb ""can"" followed by the base form ""request."" That seems right. However, I should check the preposition after ""request."" Usually, we say ""request a refund"" without ""for,"" so ""request for a refund"" might be incorrect. But the main question is about the verb agreement, so maybe that's a separate issue.

Now, Sentence B: ""The traveller pay the vat over goods in the shop, and can request for a refund when exporting the goods."" Here, the verb after ""the traveller"" is ""pay,"" which is the base form. Since the subject is third person singular, the verb should be ""pays."" So ""pay"" is incorrect here. The rest of the sentence is the same as A, including the ""request for a refund"" part.

So the main difference between A and B is the verb form ""pays"" vs. ""pay."" Since the subject is singular, ""pays"" is correct, making Sentence A grammatical and Sentence B ungrammatical. However, I should also note that ""request for a refund"" might be a minor error in both sentences, but the user is specifically asking about the grammaticality between A and B, which hinges on subject-verb agreement. The ""request for"" part is a separate issue but doesn't affect the main grammaticality distinction here.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Explanation:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - In **Sentence A**, ""The traveller **pays**..."" uses the correct third-person singular verb form (""pays"") to match the singular subject ""the traveller.""  
   - In **Sentence B**, ""The traveller **pay**..."" incorrectly uses the plural/base form ""pay"" with a singular subject, violating subject-verb agreement.  

2. **Minor Issue in Both Sentences**:  
   - The phrase ""request **for** a refund"" is slightly awkward. The verb ""request"" typically does not require ""for"" (e.g., ""request a refund""). However, this does not affect the grammaticality distinction between A and B.  

**Key Takeaway**: Sentence A is correct because of proper subject-verb agreement (""pays""), while Sentence B is ungrammatical due to the mismatch (""pay"")."
2,pays,pay,0,"The traveller pays the vat over goods in the shop, and can request for a refund when exporting the goods.","The traveller pay the vat over goods in the shop, and can request for a refund when exporting the goods.",20,2397,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are about a traveler paying VAT and requesting a refund. The main difference between them is the verb form after ""The traveller"": ""pay"" in sentence A and ""pays"" in sentence B.

First, I need to check subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""The traveller,"" which is third person singular. In the present tense, third person singular verbs typically end with an ""s."" So ""pays"" would be correct, whereas ""pay"" is incorrect. That suggests sentence B is correct here.

Next, looking at the rest of the sentences. Both use ""can request for a refund."" Wait, the phrase ""request for a refund"" might not be right. Usually, ""request"" is a transitive verb, so it should be ""request a refund"" without ""for."" So both sentences have that error. But the user is specifically asking about the grammaticality between A and B, so maybe the main issue is the verb agreement. 

Also, ""vat"" should probably be capitalized as ""VAT"" since it's an acronym. But maybe that's a style choice rather than a strict grammar rule. The preposition ""over"" in ""pay the vat over goods"" seems odd. Typically, you pay VAT ""on"" goods, not ""over."" So both sentences have that issue. 

But again, the user is focusing on which sentence is grammatical. Even though both have other possible errors, the key difference is ""pay"" vs. ""pays."" Since the subject is singular, ""pays"" is correct. Therefore, sentence B is grammatical, and A is not. The other errors are present in both, but the main point of contention is the verb form. 

So the answer should point out that sentence B is correct because of subject-verb agreement, while sentence A is incorrect. Also, note the other issues in both sentences, but clarify that the primary grammatical error in A is the verb form.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Key Explanation:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - The subject ""The traveller"" is singular (third person). The verb must agree, so ""**pays**"" (Sentence B) is correct. ""Pay"" (Sentence A) lacks the required ""-s"" ending for third-person singular subjects, making it ungrammatical.  

2. **Additional Notes on Both Sentences**:  
   - **""request for a refund""**: While common in informal speech, the preposition ""for"" is unnecessary here. The standard phrasing is ""request a refund"" (without ""for"").  
   - **""vat over goods""**: The preposition ""over"" is awkward. The correct phrasing is typically ""VAT **on** goods"" (capitalized as ""VAT"" since it’s an acronym).  

### Conclusion:  
Sentence B is grammatically correct due to proper subject-verb agreement, despite minor stylistic issues. Sentence A fails primarily because of the verb form ""pay,"" which does not match the singular subject."
4,is,are,0,"Medusa's main objection is to ""the depiction of perverse sex in the witch gathering satanic scenes and one cannibal killing of a major character.","Medusa's main objection are to ""the depiction of perverse sex in the witch gathering satanic scenes and one cannibal killing of a major character.",24,2848,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are very similar except for the verb used: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B. The subject here is ""Medusa's main objection,"" which is singular because it's referring to a single objection. 

So, the main clause is ""Medusa's main objection is/are to..."" Since the subject is singular (""objection""), the verb should agree in number. That means ""is"" would be correct. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is plural, so that would be incorrect. 

Wait, but the predicate after the verb is a prepositional phrase starting with ""to,"" followed by a list of two things: ""the depiction..."" and ""one cannibal killing..."" Even though there are multiple items in the list, the subject is still singular. The verb should match the subject, not the items in the predicate. So Sentence A is correct because it uses ""is,"" and Sentence B is wrong with ""are.""

I should also check if there's any other possible confusion. Maybe the user is thinking about the items in the list making the subject plural, but no, the subject is ""objection,"" which is singular. The verb ""to be"" here is linking the subject to the complement, which doesn't affect the verb number. So definitely, Sentence A is grammatical, and B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**

- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Medusa's main objection""** (singular), so the verb must agree in number. The correct singular verb is **""is""** (Sentence A). Sentence B incorrectly uses the plural verb **""are""**, which does not match the singular subject. 

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
Subject-verb agreement requires that a singular subject take a singular verb, and a plural subject take a plural verb. Here, the singular noun phrase ""objection"" necessitates the singular verb ""is.""

**Note:**  
Both sentences have stylistic or clarity issues (e.g., the long, complex predicate), but only Sentence B violates grammatical rules."
4,is,are,0,"Medusa's main objection is to ""the depiction of perverse sex in the witch gathering satanic scenes and one cannibal killing of a major character.","Medusa's main objection are to ""the depiction of perverse sex in the witch gathering satanic scenes and one cannibal killing of a major character.",24,2848,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about Medusa's main objection. 

First, I need to look at the subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""Medusa's main objection."" Since ""objection"" is singular, the verb should agree with that. Sentence A uses ""are,"" which is plural, while Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is singular. So right away, that's a red flag for Sentence A. The verb should be ""is"" to match the singular subject.

Next, I'll check the rest of the sentences for other possible issues. Both sentences have a quotation starting after ""to,"" but the content inside the quotes seems the same. The phrases inside the quotes might have some awkward wording, like ""witch gathering satanic scenes"" and ""one cannibal killing."" Maybe ""witch gathering"" should be hyphenated as ""witch-gathering"" to make it a compound adjective modifying ""satanic scenes."" Similarly, ""one cannibal killing"" could be unclear. Perhaps ""a cannibalistic killing"" would be better. However, those are more about style or clarity rather than strict grammar. The main issue here is the subject-verb agreement.

So, Sentence A is ungrammatical because ""are"" doesn't agree with the singular subject ""objection."" Sentence B is correct with ""is."" The user might also be confused about other parts of the sentence, but the key point is the verb agreement. I should make sure to explain that clearly and maybe mention the other possible issues as additional notes.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Explanation:  
The key issue here is **subject-verb agreement**.  

- **Subject**: ""Medusa's main objection"" (singular noun phrase).  
- **Verb**: The verb must agree with the singular subject.  

**Sentence A** uses the plural verb **""are""**, which incorrectly disagrees with the singular subject.  
**Sentence B** uses the singular verb **""is""**, which correctly matches the singular subject.  

### Additional Notes:  
- Both sentences have stylistic or clarity issues in the quoted phrase (e.g., ""witch gathering satanic scenes"" could benefit from hyphens or rephrasing for clarity). However, these do not affect grammaticality.  
- The ungrammaticality of Sentence A hinges solely on the verb **""are""** clashing with the singular subject.  

**Corrected Structure**:  
*Medusa's main objection **is** to [quoted content].*"
2,connects,connect,0,The highway connects the city to thunder bay to the northwest and sudbury to the east.,The highway connect the city to thunder bay to the northwest and sudbury to the east.,16,3538,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B.

First, I need to look at the verbs in each sentence. Sentence A uses ""connects"" and Sentence B uses ""connect"". The subject of the sentence is ""the highway"", which is singular. So, the verb should agree with the singular subject. ""Connects"" is the third person singular form, so that should be correct. ""Connect"" would be used with a plural subject, like ""highways"", but here it's just one highway. So Sentence B is probably incorrect because of the verb form.

Next, checking the rest of the sentences. Both mention Thunder Bay and Sudbury. Proper nouns like city names should be capitalized. In Sentence A, ""thunder bay"" and ""sudbury"" are lowercase, which is incorrect. Similarly, in Sentence B, they're also lowercase. So both sentences have capitalization errors. But the user is focusing on grammaticality, which mainly concerns structure rather than punctuation or capitalization. However, sometimes capitalization is considered part of grammar, but maybe in this case, the main issue is subject-verb agreement.

So even though both sentences have capitalization issues, the key difference is ""connects"" vs. ""connect"". Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical (except for the capitalization), and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the verb form. But wait, the user might not consider the capitalization as part of the grammar here. Maybe they're testing subject-verb agreement. So the answer would be that Sentence A is correct, B is incorrect. But I should note the capitalization as an aside.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Explanation:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - The subject of both sentences is **""the highway""** (singular).  
   - Sentence A uses **""connects""** (singular verb), which correctly agrees with the singular subject.  
   - Sentence B incorrectly uses **""connect""** (plural verb), which does not agree with the singular subject.  

2. **Capitalization Note**:  
   While not the primary focus of the question, proper nouns like **""Thunder Bay""** and **""Sudbury""** (city names) should be capitalized in formal writing. Sentence A and B both omit this, but this does not affect the grammaticality judgment here, as the core issue is verb agreement.  

**Key Takeaway**: Sentence A is correct because it uses the singular verb form *""connects""* to match the singular subject *""the highway""*. Sentence B fails due to the mismatch between the singular subject and plural verb *""connect""*."
2,connects,connect,0,The highway connects the city to thunder bay to the northwest and sudbury to the east.,The highway connect the city to thunder bay to the northwest and sudbury to the east.,16,3538,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. 

First, I need to look at both sentences carefully. Let's start with Sentence A: ""The highway connect the city to thunder bay to the northwest and sudbury to the east."" The main verb here is ""connect."" The subject is ""the highway,"" which is singular. So, the verb should agree with the singular subject. ""Connect"" is the base form, which is used for plural subjects. So that might be a problem.

Now, Sentence B: ""The highway connects the city to thunder bay to the northwest and sudbury to the east."" Here, the verb is ""connects,"" which has an -s ending. Since the subject is singular (""highway""), the verb should be ""connects."" That seems correct. 

Wait, but maybe there's something else. Let me check the rest of the sentences. Both sentences mention ""thunder bay"" and ""sudbury."" Those are proper nouns, so they should be capitalized: Thunder Bay and Sudbury. The user didn't mention capitalization, but maybe that's a side note. The main issue is subject-verb agreement. 

In Sentence A, ""connect"" is incorrect because the subject is singular. Sentence B uses ""connects,"" which is correct. So Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical. 

I should also check if there's any other grammatical issue. The structure ""to thunder bay to the northwest"" and ""sudbury to the east"" seems okay. The prepositions are used correctly. The only error in Sentence A is the verb form. 

So the conclusion is that Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect due to subject-verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence B** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject ""the highway"" is singular, so the verb must agree in number. Sentence B correctly uses the singular verb ""connects"" (*The highway connects...*).  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses the plural verb ""connect"" (*The highway connect...*), which does not match the singular subject.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Proper nouns like ""Thunder Bay"" and ""Sudbury"" should be capitalized for full correctness, but this was not the focus of the question.  
- The structure of the sentence (e.g., ""to Thunder Bay to the northwest"") is otherwise grammatically sound in both examples."
6,try,tries,0,With the quark flavor the theorists try to get back the causality principle to physics.,With the quark flavor the theorists tries to get back the causality principle to physics.,15,4243,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about theorists using quark flavor to bring back the causality principle in physics.

First, I need to look at both sentences carefully. Let's start with Sentence A: ""With the quark flavor the theorists try to get back the causality principle to physics."" The subject here is ""the theorists,"" and the verb is ""try."" In Sentence B, it's ""the theorists tries..."" so the verb is ""tries.""

Now, subject-verb agreement is a basic grammar rule. The subject ""the theorists"" is plural because it ends with an ""s"" and refers to multiple people. The verb needs to agree with that. For plural subjects, we use the base form of the verb without an ""s."" So ""theorists try"" is correct because ""try"" is the plural form. In Sentence B, ""tries"" has an ""s,"" which is singular, so ""theorists tries"" would be incorrect. That makes Sentence B ungrammatical.

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something else. The structure of both sentences starts with a prepositional phrase ""With the quark flavor,"" which is fine. The main clause is ""the theorists try/tries..."" So the key difference is the verb form. Since ""theorists"" is plural, the verb should be ""try."" Sentence B uses ""tries,"" which is singular, so it doesn't agree. Therefore, Sentence A is correct, and B is wrong.

I don't see any other issues. The rest of the sentence structure seems okay. The phrase ""get back the causality principle to physics"" might be a bit awkward, but the user is specifically pointing out the grammaticality related to subject-verb agreement. So the main error in Sentence B is the verb form. Yep, that's it. So the answer should be that Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Explanation:  
The key issue is **subject-verb agreement**:  
- **Subject**: ""the theorists"" (plural).  
- **Verb in Sentence A**: ""try"" (plural form, correct agreement).  
- **Verb in Sentence B**: ""tries"" (singular form, incorrect agreement).  

Since ""theorists"" is plural, the verb must also be plural (""try""). Sentence B incorrectly uses the singular verb ""tries,"" violating grammatical rules.  

### Additional Notes:  
- Both sentences have stylistic awkwardness (e.g., ""get back the causality principle to physics"" could be rephrased for clarity).  
- However, the primary grammatical error in Sentence B is the subject-verb mismatch.  

**Conclusion**: Sentence A is correct; Sentence B is not."
6,try,tries,0,With the quark flavor the theorists try to get back the causality principle to physics.,With the quark flavor the theorists tries to get back the causality principle to physics.,15,4243,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are:

Sentence A: With the quark flavor the theorists tries to get back the causality principle to physics.

Sentence B: With the quark flavor the theorists try to get back the causality principle to physics.

First, I need to compare the two sentences. The main difference between them is the verb form: ""tries"" in A and ""try"" in B. The subject in both cases is ""the theorists."" 

Now, ""theorists"" is a plural noun, right? So the verb should agree with the subject in number. For plural subjects, we use the base form of the verb without an 's'. So ""theorists try"" would be correct, whereas ""theorists tries"" is incorrect because ""tries"" is third person singular. 

Wait, but let me double-check. The subject here is ""the theorists,"" which is plural. So the verb should be ""try"" to agree. Sentence B uses ""try,"" which is correct. Sentence A uses ""tries,"" which is singular, so that's a subject-verb agreement error. 

Another thing to check: the rest of the sentence structure. The phrase ""With the quark flavor"" is a prepositional phrase at the beginning, which is okay. Then the main clause is ""the theorists try/tries to get back the causality principle to physics."" The infinitive ""to get back"" is correct. The phrase ""get back the causality principle to physics"" might sound a bit awkward. Maybe ""bring back the causality principle to physics"" would be better, but that's not part of the question. The main issue here is the subject-verb agreement. 

So, Sentence A is ungrammatical because of ""tries"" with a plural subject. Sentence B is correct with ""try."" 

Wait, are there any other possible issues? Let me check the articles. ""The quark flavor"" uses the definite article, which is fine if they're referring to a specific flavor. ""The causality principle"" also uses ""the,"" which is correct because it's a specific principle. 

The structure ""get back... to physics"" – usually, ""get back"" might be followed by ""into"" or ""to,"" but ""to physics"" is acceptable here. Maybe ""restore the causality principle to physics"" would be more idiomatic, but again, that's not the focus. 

So, the key difference is ""tries"" vs. ""try."" Since the subject is plural, ""try"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence B** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject ""the theorists"" is plural, so the verb must agree in number.  
- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses the singular verb ""tries"" (*""the theorists tries""*), violating subject-verb agreement.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses the plural verb ""try"" (*""the theorists try""*), matching the plural subject.  

**Note:** While both sentences have stylistic awkwardness (e.g., ""get back the causality principle to physics"" could be rephrased for clarity), the critical grammatical error in Sentence A is the subject-verb disagreement."
14,suggests,suggest,0,"Bowl scrapers (also known as rubber feet) are, as the name suggests, used to remove material from mixing bowls.","Bowl scrapers (also known as rubber feet) are, as the name suggest, used to remove material from mixing bowls.",19,4315,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are almost identical except for the verb after ""as the name...""—one uses ""suggests"" and the other ""suggest"". 

First, I need to figure out the subject-verb agreement here. The phrase in question is ""as the name suggests/suggest"". The subject here is ""the name"", which is singular. So the verb should agree with a singular subject. ""Suggests"" is third person singular, while ""suggest"" is plural or first/second person singular.

So, ""the name suggests"" is correct because ""name"" is singular. Therefore, Sentence A with ""suggests"" should be correct, and Sentence B with ""suggest"" is incorrect. 

Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. Could ""rubber feet"" be affecting the verb? Let me check the structure again. The main clause is ""Bowl scrapers... are... used to remove..."". The parenthetical ""(also known as rubber feet)"" is just additional info. The phrase ""as the name suggests"" is a dependent clause. The subject of that clause is ""name"", so the verb must agree with ""name"", not with ""Bowl scrapers"" or ""rubber feet"". 

Therefore, ""suggests"" is correct. Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is not. I should also explain why the parenthetical doesn't affect the verb agreement here because it's non-restrictive. The main clause's verb is ""are"", which agrees with ""Bowl scrapers"" (plural), but the dependent clause's verb is separate. So the user might be confused if they think the plural ""rubber feet"" affects the verb in the dependent clause, but it doesn't. 

Another angle: sometimes people might mistakenly use plural verbs after collective nouns, but ""name"" is clearly singular. So ""suggests"" is right. Yeah, I think that's solid. So the answer is Sentence A is correct, Sentence B is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The phrase *""as the name suggests""* in Sentence A is correct because the subject of the clause is *""the name""* (singular), which requires the third-person singular verb *""suggests""*.  

In Sentence B, *""as the name suggest""* is incorrect because *""suggest""* is the plural form of the verb, which does not agree with the singular subject *""name""*.  

The parenthetical phrase *""(also known as rubber feet)""* does not affect the verb agreement in this case, as it is a non-restrictive appositive providing additional information about *""bowl scrapers""*. The verb in the dependent clause (*""as the name suggests""*) must still agree with its own subject (*""name""*).  

**Correct Sentence:**  
*Bowl scrapers (also known as rubber feet) are, as the name suggests, used to remove material from mixing bowls.*"
14,suggests,suggest,0,"Bowl scrapers (also known as rubber feet) are, as the name suggests, used to remove material from mixing bowls.","Bowl scrapers (also known as rubber feet) are, as the name suggest, used to remove material from mixing bowls.",19,4315,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are almost identical except for the verb after ""as the name...""—one uses ""suggest"" and the other ""suggests"". 

First, I need to figure out the subject-verb agreement here. The phrase in question is ""as the name suggest(s)"". The subject here is ""the name"", which is singular. So, the verb should agree with a singular subject. That would mean using ""suggests"" instead of ""suggest"". 

Wait, but sometimes in English, even if the subject seems singular, there might be exceptions. Let me think. For example, collective nouns can sometimes take plural verbs, but ""name"" is a singular noun, not a collective noun. So ""the name suggests"" is correct.

Looking at Sentence A: ""...as the name suggest..."" – that's using the plural form of the verb with a singular subject, which is incorrect. Sentence B uses ""suggests"", which is the third person singular form, so that's correct. 

Another way to check is to rephrase the sentence. If I say ""the name suggests"", that sounds right. If I say ""the name suggest"", it sounds off. For example, ""The name of the tool suggests its function."" Correct. ""The name suggest..."" would be wrong unless the subject were plural, like ""names suggest"".

So, Sentence B is grammatical because the verb agrees with the singular subject ""name"". Sentence A is ungrammatical because it uses the plural verb ""suggest"" with a singular subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The key difference lies in the verb agreement within the clause *""as the name suggest(s)""*.  
- **Subject:** *""the name""* (singular).  
- **Correct verb form:** *""suggests""* (third-person singular).  

In **Sentence A**, *""suggest""* incorrectly uses the plural form with a singular subject.  
In **Sentence B**, *""suggests""* properly agrees with the singular noun *""name""*.  

**Correct Sentence (B):**  
*Bowl scrapers (also known as rubber feet) are, as the name suggests, used to remove material from mixing bowls.*"

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B.

First, I'll look at both sentences to spot the differences. The main difference I notice is in the verb following ""some people."" Sentence A uses ""are"" and Sentence B uses ""is."" 

So, the key here is subject-verb agreement. The subject in question is ""some people."" Now, ""people"" is a plural noun. The singular form is ""person,"" but ""people"" is plural. Therefore, the verb should agree with a plural subject. That means ""are"" is correct, and ""is"" would be incorrect because ""is"" is singular. 

Looking at the structure of the sentences, both start with ""Give how touchy..."" Wait, ""Give"" here might be a typo. The correct word to start a clause like this is usually ""Given,"" not ""Give."" ""Given"" is a preposition meaning ""taking into account,"" whereas ""Give"" is a verb. So that's another error in both sentences. But the user is focusing on the difference between ""are"" and ""is,"" so maybe that's the main point here. 

But even if ""Given"" was intended, both sentences have ""Give,"" which is incorrect. However, assuming that's a typo and the user is more concerned with the verb agreement, then Sentence A uses ""are"" correctly with ""people,"" and Sentence B incorrectly uses ""is."" 

Another thing to check: ""speakers mouths"" should be ""speakers' mouths"" with an apostrophe to show possession. Both sentences miss that, but maybe that's a separate issue. The user might not be focusing on punctuation here, just the verb agreement. 

So, putting it all together: Sentence A has the correct verb ""are"" for ""some people,"" while Sentence B incorrectly uses ""is."" The initial ""Give"" should be ""Given,"" but both sentences have that error. However, based on the user's question, the main issue is the verb agreement. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical (except for the ""Give"" typo), and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of ""is"" with ""people.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical** (with minor punctuation issues).  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement:**  
   - In Sentence A, ""some people **are**"" is correct because ""people"" is plural and requires the plural verb ""are.""  
   - In Sentence B, ""some people **is**"" is incorrect. ""Is"" is singular and cannot pair with the plural subject ""people.""  

2. **Other Issues (Both Sentences):**  
   - **""Give"" → ""Given"":** Both sentences incorrectly use ""Give"" instead of ""Given"" to introduce the clause. ""Given"" (meaning ""considering"") is the correct preposition here.  
   - **Punctuation:** ""Speakers mouths"" should be ""speakers' mouths"" (possessive apostrophe).  

**Key Takeaway:**  
The critical grammatical error in Sentence B is the mismatch between the plural subject ""people"" and the singular verb ""is."" Sentence A, while imperfect in punctuation, correctly uses ""are."""

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are almost the same except for the verb used with ""some people."" Sentence A uses ""is"" and Sentence B uses ""are."" 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs. Now, the subject here is ""some people."" The word ""people"" is a plural noun. Even though ""some"" can sometimes be tricky because it can be used with both singular and plural nouns, in this case, ""people"" is definitely plural. So the verb should be plural as well.

Looking at Sentence A: ""some people is."" That's incorrect because ""is"" is singular. The correct form should be ""are."" So Sentence A is ungrammatical. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which matches the plural subject ""people,"" so that's correct. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes there are exceptions or cases where the subject might not be what it seems. For example, ""some people"" as a collective noun? No, ""people"" is already plural. The singular is ""person."" So ""people"" is plural, so ""are"" is right. 

Another thing to check: the structure of the sentence. The beginning is ""Give how touchy..."" Wait, ""Give"" here might be a typo. Maybe it should be ""Given how touchy..."" Because ""given"" is a preposition meaning ""considering"" or ""taking into account."" If it's ""Give,"" that doesn't make sense. But both sentences have ""Give,"" so maybe that's part of the error. However, the user is focusing on the ""is"" vs. ""are"" part. 

Assuming that ""Give"" is a typo and should be ""Given,"" but since both sentences have the same structure, the main difference is the verb. So regardless of that, the subject-verb agreement is the key here. 

So conclusion: Sentence A is incorrect because ""people are"" requires ""are,"" not ""is."" Sentence B is correct. 

Also, there's another possible error in the sentences: ""speakers mouths"" should be ""speakers' mouths"" with an apostrophe to show possession. But the user didn't ask about that, so maybe that's a separate issue. The main focus is on ""is"" vs. ""are."" 

Therefore, the answer is that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The error lies in the subject-verb agreement in the clause *""how touchy some people is/are""*.  
  - **""People""** is a plural noun, so it requires the plural verb **""are""** (Sentence B).  
  - Using **""is""** (Sentence A) incorrectly pairs a singular verb with a plural subject.  

**Additional Notes:**  
1. The phrase *""Give how touchy...""* likely contains a typo. It should be **""Given how touchy...""** (meaning ""Considering how touchy..."").  
2. *""Speakers mouths""* should be **""speakers' mouths""** (with an apostrophe to indicate possession).  

However, the core grammatical issue is the **subject-verb agreement**, making Sentence B correct."
8,becomes,become,0,De 1a passes more residences before the road becomes undivided again and comes to an intersection with christian street.,De 1a passes more residences before the road become undivided again and comes to an intersection with christian street.,19,4475,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are very similar, so I need to look closely at the differences.

First, I'll read both sentences again. Sentence A says, ""the road becomes undivided again,"" while Sentence B has ""the road become undivided again."" The main difference here is the verb form after ""road."" In Sentence A, it's ""becomes,"" and in Sentence B, it's ""become.""

Now, I need to check subject-verb agreement. The subject in both cases is ""the road,"" which is third person singular. The verb should agree with that. The base form of the verb is ""become,"" but for third person singular present tense, it should be ""becomes."" So ""the road becomes"" is correct, and ""the road become"" is incorrect. That would make Sentence A correct and Sentence B wrong.

Wait, but maybe there's something else. Let me check the rest of the sentences to see if there are other issues. Both sentences have ""comes to an intersection with christian street."" The word ""christian"" should be capitalized as it's part of a proper noun, ""Christian Street."" So both sentences have a lowercase ""c"" in ""christian,"" which is incorrect. However, the user's main focus is on the grammaticality between A and B, specifically the verb ""becomes"" vs. ""become."" The capitalization might be a separate issue, but since the user is asking about grammaticality, not punctuation or capitalization, the key point is the subject-verb agreement.

So, even though both sentences have a capitalization error, the main grammatical issue here is the verb form. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of ""become"" instead of ""becomes.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- In Sentence A, the verb ""becomes"" correctly agrees with the singular subject ""the road"" (third-person singular).  
- In Sentence B, ""become"" is incorrect because it does not agree with the singular subject ""the road"" (it should be ""becomes"").  

**Additional Note:**  
Both sentences have a minor capitalization error: ""christian street"" should be ""Christian Street"" (proper nouns require capitalization). However, this does not affect the grammaticality distinction between the two sentences."
8,becomes,become,0,De 1a passes more residences before the road becomes undivided again and comes to an intersection with christian street.,De 1a passes more residences before the road become undivided again and comes to an intersection with christian street.,19,4475,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are very similar, but there's a difference in the verb form after ""the road."" Sentence A uses ""become"" while Sentence B uses ""becomes."" 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""the road,"" which is third person singular. In the present tense, third person singular subjects take verbs ending in -s. So ""becomes"" would be correct. Sentence B uses ""becomes,"" so that should be correct. Sentence A uses ""become,"" which is the base form and doesn't agree with the singular subject.

Wait, but there's also a compound predicate here: ""before the road becomes undivided again and comes to an intersection..."" Both verbs ""becomes"" and ""comes"" are connected by ""and."" Since the subject is singular, both verbs need to be in the third person singular form. In Sentence A, ""become"" is incorrect because it's not matching the singular subject. Sentence B has ""becomes"" and ""comes,"" both correct for third person singular. 

Also, checking the rest of the sentence for other possible issues. The phrase ""De 1a"" might be a road name, so capitalizing ""De"" could be correct if it's part of the name, but ""christian street"" in both sentences isn't capitalized. Proper nouns like street names should have each significant word capitalized, so ""Christian Street"" should be capitalized. However, the user's main focus is on the verb agreement, so maybe the capitalization is a separate issue but not the main point here. 

So the key difference is ""become"" vs. ""becomes."" Since the subject is singular, ""becomes"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The key difference lies in **subject-verb agreement**:  
- In Sentence A, the verb ""become"" does not agree with the singular subject ""the road.""  
- In Sentence B, ""becomes"" correctly matches the singular third-person subject (""the road"").  

### Additional Notes:  
1. **Compound Verb Structure**: Both sentences use ""becomes/come"" and ""comes"" in a compound structure (""becomes... and comes""). Sentence B maintains consistency with the singular subject by using ""becomes"" (correct) and ""comes"" (correct).  
2. **Capitalization Issue**: Both sentences incorrectly lowercase ""christian street."" Proper nouns like street names should be capitalized: **Christian Street**.  

**Corrected Version of Sentence B**:  
*De 1a passes more residences before the road becomes undivided again and comes to an intersection with Christian Street.*"
7,falls,fall,0,"If he falls asleep and his head falls, the signal will no longer be blocked and the movie will pause.","If he falls asleep and his head fall, the signal will no longer be blocked and the movie will pause.",20,4661,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B.

First, I need to look at the difference between them. The main difference is in the verb after ""his head."" Sentence A uses ""falls"" and Sentence B uses ""fall."" 

So, the structure here is a conditional sentence starting with ""If he falls asleep and his head..."" The question is about subject-verb agreement. The subject in the second part is ""his head,"" which is third person singular. So the verb should agree with that. 

In Sentence A, ""falls"" is third person singular, which matches ""his head."" That seems correct. In Sentence B, ""fall"" is the base form, which would be used for plural subjects or with ""I,"" ""you,"" ""we,"" ""they."" Since ""his head"" is singular, ""fall"" doesn't agree. 

Wait, but maybe there's a subjunctive mood here? Sometimes in conditional clauses, especially with ""if,"" the subjunctive is used. However, the subjunctive form for third person singular would still be ""fall,"" like ""If he fall..."" But that's more archaic or formal, and usually in modern English, we use the past tense for subjunctive in conditionals. For example, ""If I were..."" instead of ""If I was..."" 

But in this case, the sentence is in the present tense. The first part is ""If he falls asleep,"" which is present indicative. The second part is connected with ""and,"" so both verbs should be in the same tense. Since ""falls"" is correct in the first part, the second verb should also be ""falls."" 

Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical because ""his head falls"" uses the correct third person singular form. Sentence B is ungrammatical because ""fall"" doesn't agree with the singular subject ""his head."" 

I should also check if there's any other grammatical issue, but the main point seems to be subject-verb agreement here. No other errors stand out. So the conclusion is that Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- In **Sentence A**, the verb ""falls"" correctly agrees with the singular subject ""his head"" (third-person singular). The structure ""his head falls"" is standard for present-tense subject-verb agreement.  
- In **Sentence B**, ""fall"" does not agree with the singular subject ""his head."" The base form ""fall"" would only be appropriate for plural subjects (e.g., ""their heads fall"") or in subjunctive/imperative moods, which are not applicable here.  

The error in Sentence B violates the rule of subject-verb agreement, making it ungrammatical."
7,falls,fall,0,"If he falls asleep and his head falls, the signal will no longer be blocked and the movie will pause.","If he falls asleep and his head fall, the signal will no longer be blocked and the movie will pause.",20,4661,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are about someone falling asleep and their head moving, which affects a signal and pauses a movie.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is in the verb used after ""his head."" Sentence A uses ""fall"" while Sentence B uses ""falls."" 

Let me break down the sentences. The first part of both is ""If he falls asleep and his head..."" Here, ""he falls asleep"" is correct because ""falls"" agrees with the third person singular subject ""he."" Now, the next part is ""his head fall"" vs. ""his head falls."" 

In Sentence A, ""his head fall"" uses the base form ""fall,"" but the subject ""his head"" is third person singular. So the verb should be ""falls"" to agree with the subject. Using ""fall"" here would be incorrect because it doesn't have the -s ending needed for third person singular in present tense. 

Sentence B uses ""falls,"" which matches the subject ""his head."" That makes the verb agree properly. So Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.

Wait, but maybe there's a subjunctive mood or something else? Hmm. The sentence is a conditional starting with ""if."" In conditional clauses, sometimes the subjunctive is used, but that's more for hypothetical or unreal situations. For example, ""If I were..."" But here, the situation is a possible real event, so the indicative mood is appropriate. Therefore, ""falls"" is correct because it's in the indicative present tense, agreeing with ""his head.""

Another angle: coordinating conjunctions. The structure is ""If he falls asleep and his head [verb]..."" Both verbs after ""if"" are in the present tense. Since ""he falls"" is correct, ""his head falls"" should also be correct. The conjunction ""and"" connects two independent clauses here, so each should have proper subject-verb agreement. 

So yes, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is not because ""fall"" doesn't agree with ""his head.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- In **Sentence A**, the phrase *""his head fall""* contains a subject-verb agreement error. The subject *""his head""* (third-person singular) requires the verb *""falls""* (with an -s ending) to agree in number and person. The base form *""fall""* is incorrect here.  
- **Sentence B** corrects this error by using *""his head falls""*, ensuring proper agreement between the subject and verb.  

The rest of both sentences is structurally sound, but the error in subject-verb agreement makes Sentence A ungrammatical."
11,is,are,0,It is very important to avoid any chewing until the surgeon is satisfied with the healing.,It is very important to avoid any chewing until the surgeon are satisfied with the healing.,16,4929,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. Both are almost the same except for the verb after ""surgeon."" Sentence A uses ""is satisfied"" and Sentence B uses ""are satisfied."" 

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject in the clause is ""the surgeon."" ""Surgeon"" is a singular noun, so the verb should agree with that. ""Is"" is singular, and ""are"" is plural. So ""surgeon is"" would be correct, and ""surgeon are"" would be incorrect.

Wait, but maybe there's something else I'm missing. Let me read the sentences again. 

Sentence A: ""...until the surgeon is satisfied with the healing."" That sounds right. 

Sentence B: ""...until the surgeon are satisfied with the healing."" That sounds wrong because ""surgeon"" is singular, so ""are"" doesn't match. 

Is there any case where ""surgeon"" could be plural? If the sentence had ""surgeons"" (plural), then ""are"" would be correct. But here it's ""surgeon,"" singular. So Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement. 

Therefore, Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect. I should also explain why, mentioning subject-verb agreement. Maybe the user is learning English grammar, so pointing out the singular vs. plural would be helpful. 

I don't think there are any other grammatical issues in the sentences. The rest of the structure seems fine. ""Avoid any chewing"" is a bit formal but correct. The use of ""until"" is appropriate. So the main issue is definitely the verb following ""surgeon.""
</think>

**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: The subject ""the surgeon"" is singular, so the verb must also be singular (""**is** satisfied"").  
- **Error in Sentence B**: Using ""**are** satisfied"" (plural verb) with the singular noun ""surgeon"" violates subject-verb agreement.  

**Correct**:  
*It is very important to avoid any chewing until the surgeon **is** satisfied with the healing.*  

**Incorrect**:  
*It is very important to avoid any chewing until the surgeon **are** satisfied with the healing.*  

The error in Sentence B is a common mistake in subject-verb agreement. Always ensure the verb matches the number (singular/plural) of its subject."
11,is,are,0,It is very important to avoid any chewing until the surgeon is satisfied with the healing.,It is very important to avoid any chewing until the surgeon are satisfied with the healing.,16,4929,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about avoiding chewing until the surgeon is satisfied with the healing. 

First, I need to look at the difference between the two sentences. The main difference I notice is the verb used after ""surgeon."" Sentence A says ""surgeon are satisfied,"" while Sentence B says ""surgeon is satisfied."" 

Hmm, subject-verb agreement is a common issue in English. The subject here is ""surgeon,"" which is singular. The verb should agree with the singular subject. The verb ""are"" is plural, so ""surgeon are"" doesn't match. On the other hand, ""is"" is singular, so ""surgeon is"" would be correct.

Wait, let me double-check. ""Surgeon"" is definitely singular. If it were plural, like ""surgeons,"" then ""are"" would be correct. But since it's ""surgeon,"" the correct verb should be ""is."" Therefore, Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect because it uses the plural verb ""are"" with a singular subject.

Another thing to check: the rest of the sentences. ""Any chewing"" seems okay. ""Until the surgeon is satisfied"" makes sense. No other errors jump out. So yeah, the main issue is the subject-verb agreement in the subordinate clause starting with ""until.""

So the conclusion is that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical due to the incorrect verb form.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- **Issue:** Subject-verb agreement.  
- **Subject:** ""surgeon"" (singular).  
- **Correct verb:** ""is"" (singular form of ""to be"").  
- **Error in Sentence A:** ""surgeon are"" uses the plural verb ""are"" with a singular subject.  
- **Corrected in Sentence B:** ""surgeon is"" matches the singular subject with the singular verb.  

Thus, **Sentence B** (""...until the surgeon **is** satisfied..."") is correct."
3,is,are,0,"The next step is to hire one of the boats going out to the reserve's main attractions, isla damas, isla choros and isla chañaral.","The next step are to hire one of the boats going out to the reserve's main attractions, isla damas, isla choros and isla chañaral.",24,5361,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject in both sentences is ""The next step."" Now, ""step"" is a singular noun, so the verb should agree with it. That means the verb should be singular as well. ""Is"" is singular, and ""are"" is plural. So, ""The next step is..."" would be correct.

But wait, sometimes there are tricky cases where the subject might seem plural even if it's singular. For example, if the subject were a list of steps, then ""are"" would be correct. But here, the subject is ""the next step,"" which is definitely singular. The predicate after the verb is an infinitive phrase: ""to hire one of the boats..."" Even though the infinitive phrase might involve plural elements like multiple islands, the verb still needs to agree with the subject, not the predicate. 

So Sentence A uses ""is"" correctly with the singular subject. Sentence B incorrectly uses ""are,"" which is plural. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical. 

I should also check if there's any other possible confusion. Maybe the user is thinking about cases where the subject complement is plural. For example, ""The problem is the mistakes."" Here, ""mistakes"" is plural, but the verb still agrees with ""problem,"" which is singular. Similarly, in Sentence A, the subject complement is the infinitive phrase, which doesn't affect the verb number. 

Another point: the list of islands after ""main attractions"" is correctly separated by commas. The sentence structure seems okay otherwise. So the main issue is the verb agreement. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The subject of the sentence is **""The next step""** (singular), so the verb must agree in number.  
- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""is""** (singular verb) to match the singular subject.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""are""** (plural verb), which clashes with the singular subject.  

### Key Grammar Rule:  
**Subject-Verb Agreement** requires singular subjects to pair with singular verbs (*is*), and plural subjects with plural verbs (*are*). Here, the verb refers to ""the next step,"" not the plural list of attractions.  

### Correction:  
Only **Sentence A** is correct. Sentence B should be revised to use **""is""** instead of **""are""**."
3,is,are,0,"The next step is to hire one of the boats going out to the reserve's main attractions, isla damas, isla choros and isla chañaral.","The next step are to hire one of the boats going out to the reserve's main attractions, isla damas, isla choros and isla chañaral.",24,5361,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb: Sentence A uses ""are"" and Sentence B uses ""is"". The subject in both cases is ""The next step"". 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. Here, the subject is ""The next step"". ""Step"" is a singular noun, so the verb should agree with that. ""Is"" is singular, and ""are"" is plural. Therefore, ""The next step is..."" should be correct.

But wait, sometimes there can be tricky cases where the subject might seem plural but isn't. For example, if the subject were ""steps"", then ""are"" would be correct. But in this case, it's ""step"", singular. So Sentence B with ""is"" should be correct, making Sentence A incorrect because it uses ""are"" with a singular subject.

Let me double-check. The structure of the sentence is ""The next step is to hire..."". The predicate is an infinitive phrase, which doesn't affect the verb agreement. The part after the comma lists the main attractions, which are islands. Those are appositives, so they don't influence the subject-verb agreement either. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes people might get confused if the subject is followed by a prepositional phrase that includes a plural noun. For example, ""The list of items are..."" which is incorrect because the subject is ""list"", not ""items"". But in this case, there's no such prepositional phrase after the subject. The subject is straightforward: ""The next step"".

So, yes, Sentence B is correct because ""is"" agrees with the singular subject ""step"". Sentence A is incorrect because ""are"" is plural and doesn't match the singular subject. 

I should also check if there's any other possible issue in the sentences. The list of islands is separated by commas, and they are proper nouns. The user might have intended to capitalize ""Isla"" each time, but that's a capitalization issue, not a grammatical one related to the verb. The main focus here is on the verb agreement. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical due to the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""The next step""* (singular), so the verb must agree in number. The correct singular verb is **""is""** (Sentence B). Sentence A incorrectly uses **""are""** (plural), which clashes with the singular subject.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-verb agreement**: ""Step"" (singular) → ""is"" (singular).  
- The plural nouns in the list (*isla damas, isla choros, isla chañaral*) do not affect the verb agreement because they are part of the predicate, not the subject.  

**Note:** Proper nouns like *Isla Damas* should be capitalized for full correctness, but this does not impact the grammaticality of the verb choice."
2,drain,drains,0,"Winter rains drain through the soil into fissures in the strata of limestone bedrock, and flow through underground watercourses into the adriatic.","Winter rains drains through the soil into fissures in the strata of limestone bedrock, and flow through underground watercourses into the adriatic.",22,6142,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. Both are very similar except for the verb in the first part: ""drain"" in A and ""drains"" in B. The rest of the sentence structure seems the same.

First, I need to check subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""Winter rains."" ""Rains"" is plural, so the verb should agree with that. ""Drain"" is plural, and ""drains"" is singular. So ""Winter rains drain"" would be correct because plural subject takes plural verb. Sentence A uses ""drain,"" which is correct. Sentence B uses ""drains,"" which is incorrect because it's singular with a plural subject.

Next, looking at the rest of the sentence. Both sentences have ""flow through underground..."" The subject here is still ""Winter rains,"" so ""flow"" is correct because it's plural. If the verb were ""flows,"" that would be wrong. But both sentences use ""flow,"" so that part is okay.

Another thing to check is the use of ""adriatic."" It should be capitalized since it's a proper noun referring to the Adriatic Sea. Both sentences have it lowercase, which is a mistake, but the user is asking about grammaticality, which might focus more on structure than capitalization. However, sometimes proper nouns are considered part of grammar. But maybe the main issue here is the subject-verb agreement.

So, the main error in Sentence B is ""drains"" with ""Winter rains."" Sentence A is correct in that aspect. The other parts are the same. So the answer should be that Sentence A is grammatical, and B is ungrammatical due to the verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement:**  
  - In **Sentence A**, the plural subject *""Winter rains""* correctly pairs with the plural verb *""drain""*.  
  - In **Sentence B**, *""drains""* (singular verb) incorrectly agrees with the plural subject *""Winter rains""*.  

- **Additional Note:**  
  Both sentences contain a minor error: *""adriatic""* should be capitalized as *""Adriatic""* (referring to the Adriatic Sea). However, this does not affect the core grammaticality distinction between the two sentences.  

The critical issue is the subject-verb agreement in the first clause, making **Sentence B** ungrammatical."
2,drain,drains,0,"Winter rains drain through the soil into fissures in the strata of limestone bedrock, and flow through underground watercourses into the adriatic.","Winter rains drains through the soil into fissures in the strata of limestone bedrock, and flow through underground watercourses into the adriatic.",22,6142,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both very similar except for the verb in the first part: ""drains"" in A and ""drain"" in B.

First, I need to check subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""Winter rains."" ""Rains"" is plural, so the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Drain"" is plural, and ""drains"" is singular. So, ""Winter rains drain"" would be correct because plural subject takes plural verb. That makes Sentence B correct. 

Wait, but maybe there's something else. Let me look again. The sentence structure: the first verb is ""drain/drains,"" then after ""and"" it's ""flow."" So both verbs are connected by ""and,"" so they should both agree with the same subject. If the subject is plural, both verbs should be plural. In Sentence A, ""drains"" is singular, which doesn't agree with ""rains,"" so that's an error. Sentence B uses ""drain"" and ""flow,"" both plural, so that's correct. 

Also, checking the rest of the sentence for other possible issues. The user mentioned ""adriatic"" in both sentences. That should be capitalized as ""Adriatic"" since it's a proper noun referring to the Adriatic Sea. But the user's question is about grammaticality between A and B, so maybe that's a typo but not the main issue here. The main issue is subject-verb agreement. 

So conclusion: Sentence B is grammatical because ""rains"" (plural) takes ""drain"" (plural). Sentence A is ungrammatical because ""drains"" is singular, which doesn't agree with the plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of both sentences is **""Winter rains""** (plural).  
- In **Sentence A**, the verb **""drains""** (singular) does not agree with the plural subject.  
- In **Sentence B**, the verb **""drain""** (plural) correctly matches the plural subject **""Winter rains""**.  
- Both sentences use the plural verb **""flow""** after ""and,"" which is consistent with the plural subject.  

**Note:**  
Both sentences contain a capitalization error: **""adriatic""** should be **""Adriatic""** (proper noun referring to the Adriatic Sea). However, this does not affect the grammaticality distinction between A and B."
6,prevents,prevent,0,"Kaplan, but the existing redirect prevents this without putting a qualifier in the page title.","Kaplan, but the existing redirect prevent this without putting a qualifier in the page title.",15,6162,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are almost identical except for the verb following ""redirect."" Sentence A uses ""prevents"" and Sentence B uses ""prevent."" 

First, I need to identify the subject of the verb. The subject here is ""the existing redirect."" ""Redirect"" is singular, so the verb should agree with a singular noun. The verb in question is ""prevent(s)."" The base form is ""prevent,"" and the third person singular form is ""prevents.""

So, ""redirect"" is singular, so the correct verb form should be ""prevents."" That would make Sentence A correct. Sentence B uses ""prevent,"" which is plural, so it doesn't agree with the singular subject. Therefore, Sentence B is ungrammatical.

Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. Could ""redirect"" be plural? Let me check. The sentence says ""the existing redirect,"" which uses ""a"" as an article. Wait, no, ""the existing redirect"" uses ""the,"" but ""redirect"" here is a noun. Redirect as a noun can be both countable and uncountable? Hmm. Wait, in the context of web pages, a redirect is a singular thing. So ""redirect"" here is definitely singular. So the verb should be ""prevents.""

Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and B is not. The user might be testing subject-verb agreement here. Another thing to check: sometimes with collective nouns or nouns that end with -s, people get confused. But ""redirect"" is singular, so no issue there. Yep, I think that's it. So the answer is A is correct, B is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb is **""the existing redirect""** (singular). The verb must agree in number with the singular subject.  

- **Sentence A** uses **""prevents""** (singular), which matches the singular subject.  
- **Sentence B** uses **""prevent""** (plural), which incorrectly disagrees with the singular subject.  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement.  
**Correct Sentence:** *Kaplan, but the existing redirect* ***prevents*** *this without putting a qualifier in the page title.*"
6,prevents,prevent,0,"Kaplan, but the existing redirect prevents this without putting a qualifier in the page title.","Kaplan, but the existing redirect prevent this without putting a qualifier in the page title.",15,6162,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are:

Sentence A: Kaplan, but the existing redirect prevent this without putting a qualifier in the page title.

Sentence B: Kaplan, but the existing redirect prevents this without putting a qualifier in the page title.

First, I need to compare the two sentences. The main difference between them is the verb form after ""redirect."" Sentence A uses ""prevent,"" while Sentence B uses ""prevents."" 

So, the key here is subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""the existing redirect."" Let's check if that's singular or plural. ""Redirect"" is a noun here, and since it's preceded by ""the existing,"" which is a singular article and adjective, the subject is singular. Therefore, the verb should agree with a singular subject. 

In English, singular third-person subjects (he, she, it) take verbs with an -s ending in the present tense. So ""redirect prevents"" would be correct because ""redirect"" is singular. Sentence B uses ""prevents,"" which is correct. Sentence A uses ""prevent,"" which is the base form and would be correct for a plural subject, like ""redirects prevent."" But since the subject here is singular, ""prevent"" is incorrect. 

Wait, but maybe there's something else. Let me check the sentence structure. The sentence starts with ""Kaplan, but..."" which seems like it's part of a larger sentence. The main clause is ""the existing redirect prevents this..."" The conjunction ""but"" is connecting two clauses. The first part might be something like ""I wanted to name it Kaplan, but..."" So the subject-verb agreement is crucial here. 

Another thing to consider is the tense. Both sentences are in the present tense. So ""prevents"" is present tense, third person singular. ""Prevent"" would be plural or first/second person. Since the subject is third person singular, ""prevents"" is correct. 

Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

The grammatical sentence is **Sentence B**, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical. Here's the breakdown:

### Key Issue: **Subject-Verb Agreement**
- **Subject**: ""the existing redirect"" (singular noun phrase).  
- **Verb**: Must agree with the singular subject.  

**Sentence B** uses ""**prevents**"" (singular verb), which correctly matches the singular subject.  
**Sentence A** uses ""**prevent**"" (plural verb), which clashes with the singular subject, making it ungrammatical.

---

### Why Sentence B is Correct:
- ""Redirect"" is singular, so the verb must be ""prevents"" (third-person singular present tense).  
- Example: ""The redirect **prevents**..."" (correct) vs. ""The redirect **prevent**..."" (incorrect).

### Why Sentence A is Incorrect:
- ""Prevent"" is used for plural subjects (e.g., ""redirects prevent...""). Since the subject is singular, this creates a grammatical error.

---

**Final Answer**:  
✅ **Sentence B** is grammatical.  
❌ **Sentence A** is ungrammatical."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to check subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""This title."" ""Title"" is singular, so the verb should agree with a singular subject. ""Is"" is singular, and ""are"" is plural. Therefore, ""This title is..."" would be correct, making Sentence A grammatical. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which doesn't agree with the singular subject, so it's ungrammatical.

Wait, but maybe there's something else. Let me double-check. The rest of the sentence structure seems the same. Both have ""a must for threadgill fans..."" and the rest. The only difference is the verb. So yes, the key issue is subject-verb agreement. ""This title"" is definitely singular. So Sentence A is correct, B is wrong. 

I should also check if ""threadgill"" should be capitalized. It might be a proper noun, like a surname (Threadgill), but the user didn't mention that as an issue. The question is about grammar, not capitalization or spelling, so maybe that's irrelevant here. 

Another point: ""worthwhile for those interested..."" – that part is the same in both sentences, so no problem there. The conjunction ""and also"" is used correctly to connect the two adjectives. 

So the conclusion is that Sentence A is grammatical because the verb agrees with the singular subject, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because the plural verb ""are"" doesn't match the singular subject ""title.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
  - The subject ""This title"" (singular) correctly agrees with the singular verb ""is"".  
  - Structure: ""This title **is** a must... and also worthwhile...""  

- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  
  - The plural verb ""are"" incorrectly disagrees with the singular subject ""This title"".  
  - Error: ""This title **are**..."" (should be ""is"").  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement. ""Title"" (singular) requires ""is"", not ""are""."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Both look almost the same except for the verb in the first part. Sentence A uses ""are"" and Sentence B uses ""is"". 

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""This title"". ""This"" is a singular demonstrative pronoun, so ""title"" is singular. The verb should agree with a singular subject. ""Is"" is singular, and ""are"" is plural. So ""This title are"" would be incorrect because the subject is singular but the verb is plural. Therefore, Sentence A is ungrammatical, and Sentence B is correct.

Wait, let me make sure. Sometimes there are tricky cases where the subject might seem singular but is actually plural, but in this case, ""title"" is clearly singular. There's no ambiguity here. The verb ""are"" in Sentence A doesn't match the singular subject. So yes, Sentence B is correct. 

I should also check the rest of the sentences to see if there are other issues, but the user specifically pointed out the two sentences and the difference is in the verb. The rest of the sentence structure seems okay. ""Are a must"" vs. ""is a must"". ""A must"" is a noun phrase, so the verb should agree with ""title"". 

Another thing to consider: ""must"" here is a noun, meaning something that is essential. So ""is a must"" is correct. If the subject were plural, like ""These titles are a must..."", then ""are"" would be correct. But since it's ""This title"", it's singular. 

So conclusion: Sentence B is grammatical, Sentence A is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence B** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject ""This title"" is singular, so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses the plural verb **""are""** (*This title are* → subject-verb disagreement).  
- Sentence B correctly uses the singular verb **""is""** (*This title is* → subject-verb agreement).  

The rest of both sentences is structurally identical and grammatically acceptable."
2,specializes,specialize,0,The institute specializes in applying computer tools to analysis of dna and protein sequence information.,The institute specialize in applying computer tools to analysis of dna and protein sequence information.,15,6294,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Let me read them again carefully.

Sentence A: ""The institute specializes in applying computer tools to analysis of dna and protein sequence information.""

Sentence B: ""The institute specialize in applying computer tools to analysis of dna and protein sequence information.""

Hmm, the main difference between them is the verb form after ""institute."" Sentence A uses ""specializes"" with an 's', and Sentence B uses ""specialize"" without. 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""the institute."" Now, ""institute"" is a singular noun, right? So, the verb should agree with a third-person singular subject. In present tense, that usually means adding an 's' to the verb. So ""specializes"" would be correct for a singular subject. 

Wait, but sometimes collective nouns can be tricky. In British English, sometimes collective nouns like ""team"" or ""government"" can take plural verbs if the focus is on the members. But ""institute"" is more of an entity, so I think even in British English, it would still be singular. So ""the institute specializes"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect because it uses the plural form ""specialize"" with a singular subject.

Let me check if there are any other differences. Both sentences have ""analysis of dna and protein..."" Wait, ""dna"" should probably be capitalized as ""DNA"" since it's an acronym. But the user didn't mention that, so maybe it's a typo they're not focusing on. The main issue is the verb agreement. 

Also, ""to analysis of dna..."" The preposition ""to"" here is followed by a noun phrase ""analysis..."" which is correct. So the structure ""applying tools to analysis"" is okay, though sometimes people might say ""to analyzing,"" but ""to analysis"" is a noun, so that's acceptable. So the rest of the sentence structure seems fine. 

So, conclusion: Sentence A is grammatical because the verb agrees with the singular subject ""institute,"" while Sentence B is ungrammatical because it uses the plural verb form with a singular subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject ""the institute"" is singular, so the verb must agree in number. ""Specializes"" (with an *-s*) is the correct third-person singular form.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses ""specialize"" (plural verb form) with a singular subject, violating subject-verb agreement.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- While ""DNA"" should be capitalized as an acronym, this does not affect grammaticality in the given context.  
- The phrase ""to analysis"" is grammatically acceptable here (preposition + noun), though ""to analyzing"" (gerund) could also work."
2,specializes,specialize,0,The institute specializes in applying computer tools to analysis of dna and protein sequence information.,The institute specialize in applying computer tools to analysis of dna and protein sequence information.,15,6294,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. Both are very similar except for the verb after ""The institute."" Sentence A uses ""specialize"" and Sentence B uses ""specializes."" 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""The institute."" ""Institute"" is a singular noun, so the verb should agree with a third-person singular subject. Normally, in present tense, verbs take an -s ending for third-person singular. So ""specializes"" would be correct.

Wait, but sometimes collective nouns can be tricky. For example, in British English, sometimes collective nouns like ""team"" or ""government"" can take plural verbs if the focus is on the members. But ""institute"" is an organization, so I think in both American and British English, it's usually treated as singular. So ""specializes"" should be right. Therefore, Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect because it uses ""specialize"" without the -s, which doesn't agree with the singular subject.

Also, looking at the rest of the sentences, both use ""analysis of dna..."" which might have capitalization issues (DNA should be uppercase), but the user is only asking about the verb agreement. So the main issue is ""specialize"" vs. ""specializes."" 

Another thing to check: is there any other subject that could be plural? The sentence starts with ""The institute,"" so the verb must agree with that. No other subjects are present. So yes, definitely Sentence B is correct. Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of both sentences is ""The institute,"" which is singular.  
- In the present tense, singular third-person subjects (e.g., ""institute"") require verbs ending in **-s** (e.g., ""specializes"").  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses ""specialize"" (plural verb form) with a singular subject.  
- Sentence B correctly uses ""specializes"" (singular verb form), adhering to subject-verb agreement.  

**Note:** Minor issues like ""dna"" (should be capitalized as ""DNA"") exist in both sentences, but the primary grammatical error in Sentence A is the verb form."
3,occurs,occur,0,"If hair loss occurs in a young man with no family history, drug use could be the cause.","If hair loss occur in a young man with no family history, drug use could be the cause.",18,6342,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. 

First, I need to look at the difference between them. The main difference is the verb form after ""if hair loss"". Sentence A uses ""occurs"" and Sentence B uses ""occur"". 

Hmm, right. The structure here is a conditional sentence. The first part is the ""if"" clause, and the second part is the result. In conditional sentences, especially the first conditional, the structure is usually ""if + present simple, will + base verb"" or similar modals. But here, the result part uses ""could be"", which is a modal verb indicating possibility.

Now, focusing on the ""if"" clause: ""If hair loss occurs..."" vs. ""If hair loss occur..."". The subject here is ""hair loss"", which is singular. So the verb needs to agree with a singular subject. ""Occurs"" is third person singular present tense, while ""occur"" is the base form or plural. Since ""hair loss"" is singular, ""occurs"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is not because it uses ""occur"" with a singular subject.

Wait, but maybe there's a subjunctive mood here? Sometimes in conditional sentences, especially in formal contexts, the subjunctive is used. The subjunctive form for the third person singular would be the base verb, like ""If he be"", but that's pretty archaic. In modern English, the subjunctive is more common with ""were"" for past tense, like ""If I were"". For present tense, we usually just use the normal present tense. So in this case, since it's a real conditional (not hypothetical), the verb should agree normally. So ""occurs"" is correct. 

Another angle: maybe the user is confused about subject-verb agreement. ""Hair loss"" is a singular noun phrase, so the verb must be singular. ""Occurs"" is singular, ""occur"" is plural. So Sentence B is incorrect because it pairs a singular subject with a plural verb. 

Therefore, the answer is that Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical due to subject-verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the conditional clause, ""hair loss,"" is singular. In English, singular subjects require verbs conjugated with the third-person singular ""-s"" ending in the present tense.  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses ""occurs"" (third-person singular) to agree with ""hair loss.""  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses ""occur"" (base form), which does not agree with the singular subject.  

The error in Sentence B violates **subject-verb agreement**, a fundamental rule of grammar. There is no subjunctive mood or other grammatical structure here that would justify using ""occur"" in this context."
3,occurs,occur,0,"If hair loss occurs in a young man with no family history, drug use could be the cause.","If hair loss occur in a young man with no family history, drug use could be the cause.",18,6342,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Let me read them again carefully.

Sentence A: ""If hair loss occur in a young man with no family history, drug use could be the cause.""
Sentence B: ""If hair loss occurs in a young man with no family history, drug use could be the cause.""

Hmm, the main difference between the two is the verb form after ""hair loss."" Sentence A uses ""occur,"" while Sentence B uses ""occurs."" I need to figure out which one is correct. 

First, I remember that in conditional sentences (like ""if"" clauses), the verb tense depends on the type of conditional. But here, both sentences are using a present tense in the ""if"" clause. Wait, but ""hair loss"" is a singular noun, right? So the subject is third person singular. In present tense, third person singular verbs usually take an -s ending. So ""hair loss occurs"" would be correct, whereas ""hair loss occur"" is missing the -s. 

Let me confirm that. The structure is ""If [condition], [result]."" The condition here is ""hair loss occur/occurs..."" Since ""hair loss"" is singular, the verb should agree in number. So ""occurs"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because it uses ""occur"" without the -s for third person singular. 

Wait, but sometimes in subjunctive mood, we use the base form of the verb. Like ""If I were..."" But in this case, is the sentence using subjunctive? The subjunctive is used for hypothetical or non-real situations. For example, ""If I were rich..."" But here, the sentence is talking about a possible real situation. So maybe it's a first conditional, which uses present simple in the if-clause. In that case, the verb should agree with the subject. So ""hair loss occurs"" is correct. 

Another way to check: if I rephrase the sentence. ""Hair loss occurs"" is a statement of fact. So in the if-clause, it's the same structure. So Sentence B is correct. Sentence A is wrong because it doesn't have the -s. 

I think that's it. So the answer is that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical due to subject-verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject ""hair loss"" is singular and third-person. In the present tense, third-person singular subjects require verbs to end in **-s** (e.g., ""occurs""). Sentence A incorrectly uses ""occur"" (lacking the -s), violating subject-verb agreement. Sentence B correctly uses ""occurs,"" making it grammatically sound.  

This is not a subjunctive mood case (which would use the base verb form for hypotheticals, e.g., ""If he be...""), as the sentence refers to a plausible real-world scenario, not an unreal/hypothetical one. Thus, standard subject-verb agreement rules apply."
2,are,is,0,"Delete arguments are more numerous and more convincing, particularly as the one keep voter admits that we lack secondary sources.","Delete arguments is more numerous and more convincing, particularly as the one keep voter admits that we lack secondary sources.",20,6346,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are a bit complex, so I need to break them down.

First, looking at Sentence A: ""Delete arguments are more numerous and more convincing, particularly as the one keep voter admits that we lack secondary sources.""

The subject here is ""Delete arguments."" The verb is ""are."" Since ""arguments"" is plural, the verb should agree. ""Are"" is correct for plural subjects. Then the sentence continues with ""more numerous and more convincing,"" which are adjectives in the comparative form. That part seems okay. The phrase ""particularly as the one keep voter admits..."" Hmm, ""the one keep voter"" sounds odd. Maybe it's a typo? Perhaps it should be ""the one kept voter"" or ""the one-keep voter""? Not sure, but the main issue is the subject-verb agreement in the first part. Since ""arguments"" is plural, ""are"" is correct. So the first part of Sentence A is grammatically correct.

Now, Sentence B: ""Delete arguments is more numerous and more convincing, particularly as the one keep voter admits that we lack secondary sources.""

Here, the subject is still ""Delete arguments,"" which is plural, but the verb is ""is,"" which is singular. That's a clear subject-verb agreement error. The verb should be ""are"" to match the plural subject. So the main clause in Sentence B is incorrect. The rest of the sentence has the same issue with ""the one keep voter,"" but that's probably a separate error. The key difference between A and B is the verb ""are"" vs. ""is."" 

Wait, but ""arguments"" is plural, so ""are"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence A is correct in subject-verb agreement, while Sentence B is wrong. However, both sentences have the phrase ""the one keep voter,"" which might be a mistake. Maybe it's supposed to be ""the one-kept voter"" or ""the one who keeps voter""? But the user didn't mention that part. The main focus is on the grammaticality of the sentences as given. So even if there's another error in both sentences, the primary issue is the subject-verb agreement in the main clause. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical (despite possible other issues), and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of ""is"" with a plural subject.
</think>

**Analysis of the Sentences:**

1. **Sentence A:**  
   *Structure:* ""Delete arguments **are** more numerous and more convincing...""  
   - **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The subject ""arguments"" is plural, so the verb ""are"" is correct.  
   - **Adjective Phrase:** ""More numerous and more convincing"" appropriately modifies the plural subject.  
   - **Ungrammatical Phrase:** The clause ""**the one keep voter**"" is nonsensical and likely a typo (e.g., ""the one-kept voter"" or ""the one key voter""). However, this does not affect the grammaticality of the main clause.  

   **Conclusion:** **Grammatical** (despite minor issues in the dependent clause).  

2. **Sentence B:**  
   *Structure:* ""Delete arguments **is** more numerous and more convincing...""  
   - **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The plural subject ""arguments"" incorrectly pairs with the singular verb ""is.""  
   - **Adjective Phrase:** ""More numerous and more convincing"" is mismatched with the singular verb ""is.""  
   - **Ungrammatical Phrase:** The same nonsensical ""the one keep voter"" appears here.  

   **Conclusion:** **Ungrammatical** (due to subject-verb disagreement in the main clause).  

**Final Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical** (with minor errors in the dependent clause).  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical** (due to ""is"" conflicting with the plural subject ""arguments"")."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are very similar except for the verb forms ""is"" and ""are"" in the first part. 

First, I need to look at the subject of each sentence. The main clause in both starts with ""Delete arguments..."" So the subject here is ""arguments."" Wait, ""arguments"" is plural, right? So the verb should agree with a plural subject. That means ""are"" would be correct. So in Sentence A, ""Delete arguments is..."" uses ""is,"" which is singular, but the subject is plural. That's a subject-verb agreement error. So Sentence A is ungrammatical.

Sentence B uses ""are,"" which matches the plural subject ""arguments."" So that part is correct. Now, looking at the rest of the sentence: ""particularly as the one keep voter admits that we lack secondary sources."" Hmm, ""the one keep voter"" seems a bit off. Maybe it's a typo? Perhaps it should be ""the one kept voter"" or ""the one key voter""? But the user hasn't mentioned that part, so maybe the focus is just on the subject-verb agreement in the first clause. 

Even if there are other issues in the sentences, the main point of the question is likely about ""is"" vs. ""are."" So based on that, Sentence B is grammatical because ""arguments are"" is correct. Sentence A is ungrammatical due to the mismatch between ""arguments"" and ""is.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Explanation:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - The subject of the first clause is **""Delete arguments""** (plural).  
   - In **Sentence A**, the verb **""is""** (singular) incorrectly agrees with the plural subject.  
   - In **Sentence B**, the verb **""are""** (plural) correctly matches the plural subject.  

   Thus, **Sentence B** follows the rule of subject-verb agreement, while **Sentence A** violates it.  

2. **Other Issues**:  
   Both sentences contain awkward phrasing (e.g., *""the one keep voter""* likely contains typos or errors unrelated to the core grammatical question). However, the primary focus here is the subject-verb agreement in the first clause.  

**Key Takeaway**:  
Use **""are""** with plural subjects like **""arguments""**. Sentence B is correct."
4,offers,offer,0,Tyndale's k-5 section offers a christ-centred education and develops a firm basis upon which middle and senior school education can be built.,Tyndale's k-5 section offer a christ-centred education and develops a firm basis upon which middle and senior school education can be built.,22,6375,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both very similar except for the verb after ""Tyndale's k-5 section."" Sentence A uses ""offers"" and Sentence B uses ""offer."" 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The main clause starts with ""Tyndale's k-5 section."" Here, ""Tyndale's"" is a possessive noun acting as an adjective modifying ""k-5 section."" So the subject is ""section,"" which is singular. 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""offers,"" which is singular, matching the singular subject ""section."" That seems correct. Then, the conjunction ""and"" connects another verb ""develops,"" which is also singular, so that's consistent.

In Sentence B, the verb is ""offer,"" which is plural. But since the subject is singular (""section""), this would be a subject-verb agreement error. The plural verb ""offer"" doesn't agree with the singular subject. 

Wait, but sometimes there's confusion with collective nouns or when the subject has a prepositional phrase. However, in this case, ""k-5 section"" is clearly the subject, and ""Tyndale's"" is just possessive. There's no prepositional phrase that could confuse the subject here. 

Another thing to check: sometimes nouns that end with 's' can be tricky, like ""news"" is singular. But ""section"" is a regular noun, and ""k-5"" is an adjective here. So ""section"" is definitely singular. 

So Sentence A is correct because ""offers"" agrees with the singular subject. Sentence B is incorrect because ""offer"" is plural, leading to a disagreement. 

I should also check if there's any other difference between the sentences. Both use ""develops,"" which is singular, so that's consistent in both. The rest of the sentence structure is the same. 

Therefore, the answer is that Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical due to the subject-verb agreement error.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""Tyndale's K-5 section""**, which is singular (referring to a single section/program).  
- In **Sentence A**, the verb **""offers""** (singular) correctly agrees with the singular subject.  
- In **Sentence B**, the verb **""offer""** (plural) incorrectly disagrees with the singular subject, creating a subject-verb agreement error.  

**Key Issue:**  
The error in Sentence B violates the rule of **subject-verb agreement**. A singular subject requires a singular verb (e.g., *offers*), while a plural subject requires a plural verb (e.g., *offer*).  

**Corrected Sentence B (for clarity):**  
*""Tyndale's K-5 section **offers** a Christ-centred education and develops a firm basis...""*"
4,offers,offer,0,Tyndale's k-5 section offers a christ-centred education and develops a firm basis upon which middle and senior school education can be built.,Tyndale's k-5 section offer a christ-centred education and develops a firm basis upon which middle and senior school education can be built.,22,6375,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both about Tyndale's k-5 section. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""offer"" in sentence A and ""offers"" in sentence B.

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""Tyndale's k-5 section."" Since ""section"" is singular, the verb should agree with a singular subject. ""Offer"" is plural, while ""offers"" is singular. So, sentence B uses ""offers,"" which matches the singular subject. That makes me think sentence B is correct.

But wait, let me make sure there's no other issue. Both sentences have a compound predicate: ""offer/offers... and develops..."" The verbs need to agree in number. If the subject is singular, both verbs should be singular. In sentence A, ""offer"" is plural and ""develops"" is singular, which is inconsistent. In sentence B, both ""offers"" and ""develops"" are singular, so they agree. That confirms that sentence B is correct and A is not.

Another thing to check: sometimes with collective nouns or possessive phrases, the number can be tricky. But here, ""section"" is clearly singular, so the verbs must be singular. Also, ""Christ-centred"" should be capitalized as ""Christ-centred"" since it's a proper noun referring to Christ. However, the user's sentences have it lowercase. But the user's question is about grammaticality, not capitalization, unless they consider that part of grammar. But in standard grammar, proper nouns need capitalization, so both sentences have an error there. But maybe the user is focusing on the verb agreement. So, assuming the focus is on the verbs, sentence B is correct.

So, conclusion: Sentence B is grammatical because the verbs agree with the singular subject. Sentence A is ungrammatical because ""offer"" doesn't agree with the singular subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of both sentences is *""Tyndale's K-5 section""* (singular noun phrase).  
- In **Sentence A**, the verb *""offer""* is plural, which incorrectly disagrees with the singular subject.  
- In **Sentence B**, the verb *""offers""* is singular, matching the singular subject. The second verb *""develops""* also correctly agrees with the subject.  

**Note:** Both sentences have a minor capitalization error (*""christ-centred""* should be *""Christ-centred""*), but this does not affect the core grammaticality distinction being tested here."
3,have,has,0,Presumed mature males have the first ray of the dorsal and pectoral fins extended into filaments except in c.,Presumed mature males has the first ray of the dorsal and pectoral fins extended into filaments except in c.,19,6746,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about presumed mature males and their fin rays. 

First, I need to look at the subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""Presumed mature males."" Since ""males"" is plural, the verb needs to agree with that. In sentence A, the verb is ""have,"" which is plural. In sentence B, it's ""has,"" which is singular. So right away, that's a red flag for sentence B.

Wait, but let me make sure. The structure is ""Presumed mature males [have/has] the first ray..."" So the subject is definitely plural, so ""have"" is correct. Sentence B uses ""has,"" which is wrong because ""has"" is for singular subjects like ""he,"" ""she,"" or ""it."" So sentence B is ungrammatical because of the verb form.

Now, checking the rest of the sentences. Both sentences after the verb seem similar: ""the first ray of the dorsal and pectoral fins extended into filaments except in c."" The structure here is a bit complex. The verb ""have"" in this context is used to indicate possession or a characteristic. So ""males have the first ray... extended into filaments."" That makes sense. The past participle ""extended"" is used as an adjective here, describing the state of the rays. 

Is there anything else that might be wrong? Maybe the use of ""except in c."" The ""c"" is probably a species abbreviation or something, but that's not relevant to the grammar. The main issue is the subject-verb agreement. 

So, conclusion: Sentence A is correct because ""have"" agrees with the plural subject ""males."" Sentence B is incorrect because ""has"" doesn't agree. I should also mention why ""has"" is wrong and maybe explain the structure a bit more to make it clear.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Explanation:  
The key issue is **subject-verb agreement**:  
- The subject of both sentences is **""Presumed mature males""** (plural).  
- The verb must agree with the plural subject.  

**Sentence A** uses **""have""** (plural verb), which correctly matches the plural subject:  
> *""Presumed mature males **have** the first ray...""* ✅  

**Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""has""** (singular verb) with the plural subject:  
> *""Presumed mature males **has** the first ray...""* ❌  

### Additional Notes:  
- The phrase *""extended into filaments""* is grammatically correct in both sentences, as it functions as a participial phrase describing the state of the rays.  
- The abbreviation *""c.""* (likely referring to a species or context) does not affect grammaticality here.  

**Conclusion:** Sentence A is correct; Sentence B violates subject-verb agreement."
3,have,has,0,Presumed mature males have the first ray of the dorsal and pectoral fins extended into filaments except in c.,Presumed mature males has the first ray of the dorsal and pectoral fins extended into filaments except in c.,19,6746,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are about presumed mature males and their fin rays.

First, I need to look at the subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""Presumed mature males."" The verb in Sentence A is ""has,"" and in Sentence B it's ""have."" 

Now, ""males"" is plural, so the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Has"" is singular, used with he/she/it. ""Have"" is plural, used with they/we/you. So, ""males have"" makes sense because ""males"" are plural. Therefore, Sentence B should be correct because ""have"" matches the plural subject. Sentence A uses ""has,"" which is singular, so that's incorrect. 

Wait, let me double-check. The structure is ""Presumed mature males [has/have] the first ray..."" Yep, the subject is definitely plural. So ""have"" is right. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical due to the subject-verb disagreement. 

I should also check if there's anything else wrong, but the main issue here is the verb. The rest of the sentence seems okay. ""Extended into filaments except in c."" Maybe ""c."" is an abbreviation, but that's probably a typo or placeholder. The key point is the verb agreement. So yes, Sentence B is correct.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of both sentences is ""Presumed mature males,"" which is plural. The verb must agree in number with the subject:  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb ""**has**"" (*""males has""*), which does not match the plural subject.  
- Sentence B correctly uses the plural verb ""**have**"" (*""males have""*), ensuring proper subject-verb agreement.  

The rest of the sentence structure is identical in both examples, so the grammaticality hinges solely on the verb choice."
7,creates,create,0,The orange (volcanic) kitchen island creates a multi-functional gathering point in the heart of the house.,The orange (volcanic) kitchen island create a multi-functional gathering point in the heart of the house.,16,6926,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both about an orange volcanic kitchen island creating a gathering point. The difference is in the verb: ""creates"" vs. ""create"". 

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""The orange (volcanic) kitchen island"". Let me parse that. The main noun is ""island"", which is singular. The adjectives ""orange"" and ""volcanic"" are just describing it, so they don't affect the number. So the subject is singular.

In sentence A, the verb is ""creates"", which is third person singular. That matches the singular subject. So sentence A should be correct. 

Sentence B uses ""create"", which is the base form or plural form. Since the subject is singular, ""create"" would be incorrect here. The correct form should be ""creates"". 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with parentheticals. The parentheses around ""volcanic"" might make someone think if it affects the subject. But parentheses just add extra information; they don't change the number of the subject. So ""kitchen island"" is still singular. 

Another thing to check: is there any other part of the sentence that could be the subject? No, the structure is straightforward. The kitchen island is the one creating the gathering point. So the verb must agree with ""island"". 

Therefore, sentence A is grammatical, and B is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence, *""The orange (volcanic) kitchen island""*, is singular. The verb must agree with the singular subject, so the correct form is **""creates""** (third-person singular). Sentence B incorrectly uses **""create""** (plural/incorrect conjugation), violating subject-verb agreement. Parenthetical phrases like *(volcanic)* do not affect grammatical number."
7,creates,create,0,The orange (volcanic) kitchen island creates a multi-functional gathering point in the heart of the house.,The orange (volcanic) kitchen island create a multi-functional gathering point in the heart of the house.,16,6926,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are almost the same except for the verb: ""create"" in A and ""creates"" in B.

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""The orange (volcanic) kitchen island."" Let me parse that. The main noun here is ""island,"" which is singular. The words ""orange"" and ""volcanic"" are adjectives describing it. So the subject is singular. 

In English, singular subjects take verbs with an -s ending in the present tense. So the verb should be ""creates"" instead of ""create."" That would make Sentence B correct and Sentence A incorrect because ""create"" is plural, but the subject is singular. 

Wait, but maybe there's something else I'm missing. Let me double-check. The parentheses around ""volcanic"" might be confusing, but they just add extra information. The core structure is still ""kitchen island creates."" So yes, the verb needs to agree with the singular subject. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes collective nouns can be tricky, but ""kitchen island"" is a singular noun, not a collective one. So no issues there. 

Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical due to the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence B** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence, *""The orange (volcanic) kitchen island,""* is singular. The verb must agree with the singular subject by using the third-person singular form *""creates""* (Sentence B). Sentence A incorrectly uses *""create""* (plural verb form), which does not match the singular subject.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
- Singular subjects require verbs ending in **-s/-es** in the present tense (e.g., *creates, runs*).  
- Plural subjects use the base verb form (e.g., *create, run*)."
1,gives,give,0,"Article gives no clues as to notability (if he is in the pdc as it says, where is the proof).","Article give no clues as to notability (if he is in the pdc as it says, where is the proof).",20,6930,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are similar except for the verb following ""Article."" Sentence A uses ""gives"" and Sentence B uses ""give."" 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""Article,"" which is singular. The verb should agree with a singular subject. The base form for present tense third person singular in English usually adds an ""s"" or ""es."" So ""gives"" would be correct for a singular subject.

Looking at Sentence A: ""Article gives no clues..."" Since ""Article"" is singular, ""gives"" is correct. Sentence B uses ""give,"" which is the base form without the ""s,"" suitable for plural subjects or first/second person. But here the subject is singular, so ""give"" would be incorrect. 

Wait, but sometimes there are exceptions. For example, in some dialects or contexts, maybe? But standard English definitely requires ""gives"" here. Also, checking the rest of the sentences, the parentheses have some issues with capitalization and punctuation, but the user is specifically asking about the grammaticality related to ""gives"" vs. ""give."" The other parts might be stylistic or have other errors, but the main focus is on the verb agreement.

So, conclusion: Sentence A is grammatical because ""Article gives"" is correct subject-verb agreement. Sentence B is ungrammatical because ""Article give"" doesn't agree in number.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject ""Article"" is singular, so the verb must agree in number. ""Gives"" (third-person singular) is correct in Sentence A. ""Give"" (plural or non-third-person) in Sentence B does not agree with the singular subject, making it ungrammatical.  

**Note:**  
Both sentences have punctuation/capitalization issues (e.g., lowercase ""article"" should be capitalized, missing commas), but the core grammatical error in Sentence B is the subject-verb disagreement."
1,gives,give,0,"Article gives no clues as to notability (if he is in the pdc as it says, where is the proof).","Article give no clues as to notability (if he is in the pdc as it says, where is the proof).",20,6930,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are almost identical except for the verb form ""give"" vs. ""gives"" in the first part. 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject of the first part of each sentence is ""Article."" Now, ""article"" is a singular noun, right? So the verb should agree with a third-person singular subject. The base form of the verb is ""give,"" and the third-person singular form is ""gives."" So, ""Article gives"" would be correct, whereas ""Article give"" is incorrect because it's using the plural form with a singular subject.

Looking at Sentence A: ""Article give no clues..."" – here, the verb ""give"" doesn't match the singular subject ""Article."" That makes Sentence A ungrammatical. 

Sentence B: ""Article gives no clues..."" – here, ""gives"" correctly matches the singular subject. So Sentence B is grammatical. 

Wait, but maybe there's something else I'm missing? Let me check the rest of the sentences. The parts in parentheses are separate clauses. The first part is the main clause, so the subject-verb agreement there is the key point. The parentheses contain a conditional clause (""if he is..."") and a question (""where is the proof""). Those parts seem okay grammatically. The main issue is definitely the verb in the main clause. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes collective nouns or certain contexts might use plural verbs, but ""article"" is a straightforward singular noun. There's no indication here that ""article"" is being used in a plural sense. So yes, ""gives"" is correct. 

Therefore, Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence B** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject ""Article"" is singular, so the verb must agree in number. ""Gives"" (third-person singular) is correct, while ""give"" (plural or first/second-person singular) is incorrect.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Sentence A:** ""Article **give**..."" → Subject-verb disagreement (singular subject + plural verb).  
- **Sentence B:** ""Article **gives**..."" → Correct agreement (singular subject + singular verb).  

The rest of the sentences (parenthetical clauses) are structurally acceptable."
2,are,is,0,Weight holders are available for integrated weight systems which can be slid over the waist belt.,Weight holders is available for integrated weight systems which can be slid over the waist belt.,16,7023,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about weight holders for integrated weight systems.

First, I need to look at both sentences carefully. Let's start with Sentence A: ""Weight holders are available for integrated weight systems which can be slid over the waist belt."" The subject here is ""Weight holders,"" and the verb is ""are."" Then Sentence B: ""Weight holders is available for integrated weight systems which can be slid over the waist belt."" Here, the subject is the same, but the verb is ""is.""

Hmm, subject-verb agreement is a common issue. The basic rule is that singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs. ""Weight holders"" is plural because it ends with an ""s"" and refers to multiple items. So the verb should agree with that. In Sentence A, ""are"" is plural, which matches ""Weight holders."" In Sentence B, ""is"" is singular, which doesn't match the plural subject. That makes Sentence B incorrect.

Wait, but maybe there's something else. Let me check the rest of the sentences. Both sentences have a relative clause: ""which can be slid over the waist belt."" The relative clause is modifying ""integrated weight systems,"" right? So the weight systems can be slid over the belt. That part seems okay in both sentences. The main issue is the subject-verb agreement in the main clause.

So Sentence A uses ""are"" correctly with the plural subject, and Sentence B incorrectly uses ""is."" Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical. I should also consider if there's any other grammatical issue, like the placement of the relative clause. In Sentence A, the clause ""which can be slid..."" is right after ""integrated weight systems,"" which is correct because it's describing the systems. If the clause were meant to describe the weight holders, it might be misplaced, but the way it's written, it's correctly modifying the systems. So that's not a problem here.

Another thing to check: ""can be slid over the waist belt."" The verb ""slide"" in passive voice is ""slid,"" which is correct. ""Slid"" is the past participle, so ""can be slid"" is the right form. So that part is okay in both sentences.

So the main and only error is in Sentence B's subject-verb agreement. Therefore, the answer is that Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement:**  
  - In **Sentence A**, the plural subject *""Weight holders""* correctly pairs with the plural verb *""are""*.  
  - In **Sentence B**, the plural subject *""Weight holders""* incorrectly pairs with the singular verb *""is""*, violating subject-verb agreement.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- The relative clause *""which can be slid over the waist belt""* correctly modifies *""integrated weight systems""* in both sentences.  
- The phrase *""can be slid""* is grammatically correct (passive voice with the past participle *""slid""*).  

**Conclusion:** Sentence B is ungrammatical due to the mismatch between the plural subject and singular verb."
2,are,is,0,Weight holders are available for integrated weight systems which can be slid over the waist belt.,Weight holders is available for integrated weight systems which can be slid over the waist belt.,16,7023,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B.

First, I need to look at the subject-verb agreement. In Sentence A, the subject is ""Weight holders"" which is plural. The verb used is ""is"" which is singular. That's a problem because plural subjects need plural verbs. So ""Weight holders is"" should be ""Weight holders are"". 

Sentence B uses ""are"" which is the correct plural form for ""Weight holders"". So that part checks out. 

Next, I should check the rest of the sentence structure. Both sentences have a relative clause starting with ""which can be slid over the waist belt."" The relative clause is correctly modifying ""integrated weight systems."" The placement of the clause might be a bit ambiguous, but in both sentences, it's attached to ""integrated weight systems,"" which makes sense. 

Another thing to consider is the preposition ""for"" in both sentences. ""Available for"" is correct here because it's indicating the purpose or compatibility. 

The verb ""slid"" is the past participle, so ""can be slid"" is correct in passive voice. 

So the main issue is the subject-verb agreement in Sentence A. Since ""Weight holders"" is plural, it should take ""are"" instead of ""is"". Therefore, Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement Error in Sentence A:**  
  The subject ""Weight holders"" is plural, but the verb ""is"" is singular. This mismatch violates grammatical rules.  
  **Correction:** ""Weight holders **are**..."" (plural subject + plural verb).  

- **Correct Structure in Sentence B:**  
  ""Weight holders **are**..."" correctly pairs the plural subject with the plural verb ""are.""  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Both sentences use the relative clause ""which can be slid over the waist belt"" appropriately to modify ""integrated weight systems.""  
- The preposition ""for"" and passive construction ""can be slid"" are grammatically sound in both sentences.  

**Conclusion:**  
Sentence B is correct due to proper subject-verb agreement, while Sentence A is ungrammatical."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. Both sentences are about inner moons and their rotations. The main difference between them is the verb used in the first part. Sentence A uses ""have"" and Sentence B uses ""has"". 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""most inner moons"". The word ""most"" indicates a plural quantity, so the subject is plural. The verb needs to agree with a plural subject. ""Have"" is the plural form for present tense, while ""has"" is singular. So ""most inner moons have"" would be correct, and ""has"" would be incorrect.

Looking at Sentence A: ""most inner moons have synchronous rotations"" – that's correct. Sentence B uses ""has"", which doesn't agree with the plural subject. So Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the verb ""has"". 

The rest of both sentences are the same: ""so their obliquities will be, by definition, zero."" That part seems fine. The error is solely in the first part of the sentence. 

I should also check if there's any other possible issue, but the main one is the subject-verb agreement. ""Most"" can sometimes be tricky, but when it's followed by a plural noun (""moons""), the verb must be plural. So yes, Sentence A is correct, B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- In Sentence A, the verb **""have""** correctly agrees with the plural subject **""most inner moons""** (plural subject + plural verb).  
- In Sentence B, the verb **""has""** is singular and does not agree with the plural subject **""most inner moons""**, violating subject-verb agreement rules.  

The error in Sentence B is isolated to the first clause; the rest of both sentences is grammatically correct."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. Both sentences are very similar, except for the verb in the first part. Sentence A uses ""has"" and Sentence B uses ""have"". 

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""most inner moons"". The word ""most"" is a quantifier, and when we use ""most"" with a plural noun, the verb should agree with the plural noun. So ""moons"" is plural, so the verb should be plural as well. ""Has"" is singular (third person singular), and ""have"" is plural. Therefore, ""most inner moons have"" is correct.

Wait, but sometimes ""most"" can be used with a singular noun if it's uncountable. For example, ""most water is clean."" But in this case, ""moons"" is definitely plural. So ""have"" is the right choice here. That would make Sentence B correct and Sentence A incorrect.

Let me double-check. The structure is ""most + [plural noun] + plural verb"". Yes, that's right. So Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject ""most inner moons"" is plural, so the verb must agree with it in number.  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb **""has""** (""most inner moons **has**"").  
- Sentence B correctly uses the plural verb **""have""** (""most inner moons **have**"").  

The rest of both sentences is structurally identical and grammatically sound.  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement (""moons"" → plural → **""have""**)."
4,believe,believes,0,"Indeed, most historians believe that the western wall became a popular prayer area only after the ottoman conquest of jerusalem in 1517.","Indeed, most historians believes that the western wall became a popular prayer area only after the ottoman conquest of jerusalem in 1517.",22,7379,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Let me read them again carefully.

Sentence A: ""Indeed, most historians believe that the western wall became a popular prayer area only after the ottoman conquest of jerusalem in 1517.""

Sentence B: ""Indeed, most historians believes that the western wall became a popular prayer area only after the ottoman conquest of jerusalem in 1517.""

Hmm, the main difference I notice is the verb following ""most historians."" In sentence A, it's ""believe,"" and in sentence B, it's ""believes."" So, the question here is subject-verb agreement. 

First, I need to determine the subject. The subject here is ""most historians."" ""Most"" can be a quantifier, and when used with a plural noun like ""historians,"" it takes a plural verb. So, ""most historians believe"" would be correct because ""believe"" is the plural form. ""Believes"" is singular, so that would be incorrect here. 

Wait, but let me double-check. The structure is ""most + plural noun,"" so the verb should indeed be plural. For example, ""most students study"" versus ""a student studies."" So in sentence B, using ""believes"" with a plural subject is wrong. Therefore, sentence B is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement. 

Another thing to check: are there any other differences between the sentences? The rest of the sentences seem identical. The capitalization of ""ottoman"" and ""jerusalem"" might be an issue, but the user is focusing on grammaticality, which typically refers to syntax rather than capitalization. However, proper nouns like ""Ottoman"" and ""Jerusalem"" should be capitalized. But since both sentences have the same lowercase usage, that's probably not the focus here. The main issue is the verb agreement. 

So, conclusion: Sentence A is correct because ""most historians believe"" uses the plural verb form. Sentence B is incorrect because it uses the singular ""believes"" with a plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The key difference lies in **subject-verb agreement**:  
- The subject **""most historians""** is plural (referring to multiple historians).  
- The verb **""believe""** (plural) correctly agrees with the plural subject in **Sentence A**.  
- In **Sentence B**, **""believes""** (singular) incorrectly pairs with the plural subject, violating grammatical rules.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- While not the focus of the question, proper nouns like **""Ottoman""** and **""Jerusalem""** should be capitalized in formal writing. However, this does not affect the grammaticality judgment here."
4,believe,believes,0,"Indeed, most historians believe that the western wall became a popular prayer area only after the ottoman conquest of jerusalem in 1517.","Indeed, most historians believes that the western wall became a popular prayer area only after the ottoman conquest of jerusalem in 1517.",22,7379,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Let me read them again carefully.

Sentence A: ""Indeed, most historians believes that the western wall became a popular prayer area only after the ottoman conquest of jerusalem in 1517.""

Sentence B: ""Indeed, most historians believe that the western wall became a popular prayer area only after the ottoman conquest of jerusalem in 1517.""

Hmm, the main difference between the two is the verb ""believes"" in A and ""believe"" in B. The subject in both cases is ""most historians."" So, I need to check subject-verb agreement here. 

The subject ""most historians"" is plural because ""historians"" is plural and ""most"" here refers to a plural noun. The verb should agree with a plural subject. The base form of the verb for plural subjects in present tense is ""believe,"" whereas ""believes"" is the third person singular form. So, ""most historians believe"" would be correct, making Sentence B grammatical. Sentence A uses ""believes,"" which doesn't agree with the plural subject, so it's ungrammatical.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes with collective nouns or quantifiers like ""most,"" ""some,"" ""all,"" the verb form can depend on whether the noun is countable or uncountable. But in this case, ""historians"" is definitely plural and countable. ""Most"" here is followed by a plural noun, so the verb should be plural. Yeah, that's right. So Sentence B is correct, and A is incorrect.

Also, looking at the other parts of the sentences, the capitalization of ""ottoman"" and ""jerusalem"" might be an issue. Both should be capitalized as proper nouns: Ottoman Empire and Jerusalem. But the user's question is about grammaticality, which typically refers to syntax rather than capitalization. However, sometimes capitalization is considered part of grammar, especially in proper nouns. But since both sentences have the same lowercase usage, maybe the user is focusing on the verb agreement. So the main issue is ""believes"" vs. ""believe.""

So, conclusion: Sentence B is grammatical because the verb agrees with the plural subject. Sentence A is ungrammatical due to the incorrect verb form.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence B** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject ""most historians"" is plural, so the verb must agree in number. ""Believe"" (plural) is correct, while ""believes"" (singular) is not.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Both sentences have capitalization errors (""ottoman"" → ""Ottoman,"" ""jerusalem"" → ""Jerusalem""), but this does not affect the core grammaticality question about subject-verb agreement.  
- The key issue is **verb conjugation**: plural subjects require plural verbs."
3,include,includes,1,"Pests of tea include mosquito bugs that can tatter leaves, so they may be sprayed with insecticides.","Pests of tea includes mosquito bugs that can tatter leaves, so they may be sprayed with insecticides.",17,19,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both talking about pests of tea, specifically mosquito bugs that damage leaves, and then mentioning they might be sprayed with insecticides.

First, I need to compare the two sentences. The main difference I notice is the verb following ""Pests of tea."" In Sentence A, it's ""include,"" and in Sentence B, it's ""includes."" So the key here is subject-verb agreement. 

The subject in both sentences is ""Pests of tea."" ""Pests"" is plural, so the verb should agree with a plural subject. The base form of the verb for plural subjects is ""include,"" whereas ""includes"" is the third person singular form. Therefore, ""Pests of tea include..."" is correct because ""include"" matches the plural subject. Sentence B uses ""includes,"" which would be correct if the subject were singular, like ""A pest of tea includes..."" but since the subject is plural, ""includes"" is incorrect here.

Let me double-check to make sure there aren't any other differences. Both sentences have ""mosquito bugs that can tatter leaves,"" which seems fine. The second part is ""so they may be sprayed with insecticides."" The pronoun ""they"" refers back to the pests, which is correct because spraying insecticides targets the pests. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes collective nouns can be tricky, but ""pests"" is clearly plural here. There's no ambiguity in number. So the error in Sentence B is definitely the verb form. 

I should also check if there's any other grammatical issue, like the use of ""so"" as a conjunction. Both sentences use ""so"" correctly to show cause and effect. The structure of the sentence is otherwise parallel. 

So, conclusion: Sentence A is grammatical because ""include"" agrees with the plural subject ""Pests."" Sentence B is ungrammatical because ""includes"" doesn't agree with the plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""Pests of tea""** (plural).  
- The verb must agree in number with the subject.  
  - **Sentence A** uses **""include""** (plural verb), which correctly matches the plural subject **""Pests""**.  
  - **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""includes""** (singular verb), which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-verb agreement** is violated in Sentence B. Only Sentence A maintains grammatical correctness.  

**Note:**  
Both sentences otherwise use proper structure (e.g., ""they may be sprayed"" correctly refers to the pests). The error in Sentence B is purely grammatical."
3,include,includes,1,"Pests of tea include mosquito bugs that can tatter leaves, so they may be sprayed with insecticides.","Pests of tea includes mosquito bugs that can tatter leaves, so they may be sprayed with insecticides.",17,19,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb: ""includes"" in A and ""include"" in B. 

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""Pests of tea."" ""Pests"" is plural, so the verb should agree with that. ""Include"" is the plural form, while ""includes"" is singular. So, sentence B uses ""include,"" which matches the plural subject. That makes me think sentence B is correct.

Looking at sentence A: ""Pests... includes..."" That's a subject-verb disagreement. The plural subject ""pests"" needs a plural verb. ""Include"" is correct here. So sentence A is incorrect because it uses the singular verb ""includes"" with a plural subject.

Another thing to check is the rest of the sentence structure. Both sentences have a dependent clause starting with ""that can tatter leaves,"" which seems fine. The second part, ""so they may be sprayed with insecticides,"" uses ""they"" correctly to refer back to the pests. 

Wait, but ""they"" could potentially refer to the pests or the leaves. However, contextually, it makes sense that the pests are the ones being sprayed with insecticides, not the leaves. So the pronoun reference is okay here. 

So the main issue is the subject-verb agreement. Sentence B is correct because ""include"" matches the plural subject ""Pests."" Sentence A is incorrect because ""includes"" doesn't agree with the plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject ""Pests of tea"" is plural, so the verb must agree in number.  
  - ✅ **Sentence B** uses ""include"" (plural verb), which correctly matches the plural subject.  
  - ❌ **Sentence A** uses ""includes"" (singular verb), which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- The pronoun ""they"" in both sentences logically refers to ""pests,"" as they are the ones being sprayed with insecticides.  
- The phrase ""that can tatter leaves"" correctly modifies ""mosquito bugs"" in both sentences.  

**Conclusion:**  
Subject-verb agreement is the key grammatical issue here. Sentence B is correct."
5,is,are,1,The arrangement of the pyramids is a disputed representation of the orion constellation in the orion correlation theory.,The arrangement of the pyramids are a disputed representation of the orion constellation in the orion correlation theory.,18,160,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about the arrangement of the pyramids representing the Orion constellation. The difference is in the verb: ""is"" vs. ""are"". 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""The arrangement"", which is singular. The verb should agree with the subject in number. So, ""arrangement"" is singular, so the verb should be singular. That would make Sentence A correct with ""is"". Sentence B uses ""are"", which is plural, so that's incorrect.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused because of the prepositional phrases. The phrase ""of the pyramids"" comes after the subject, but the subject is still ""arrangement"", not ""pyramids"". So even though ""pyramids"" is plural, the verb should still match ""arrangement"". 

Let me check examples. Like, ""The group of students is large."" Here, ""group"" is singular, so ""is"" is correct. Even though ""students"" is plural, the subject is ""group"". Similarly, ""The list of items is long."" So same structure. 

So in Sentence B, using ""are"" would be wrong because the subject is singular. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and B is ungrammatical. 

I should also check if there's any other possible issues. The rest of the sentence seems okay. ""a disputed representation"" is correct because ""arrangement"" is singular. So yes, the main issue is the verb agreement. 

Another way to test: reverse the sentence. ""A disputed representation... is the arrangement of the pyramids."" That still works. If we used ""are"", it would be ""A disputed representation... are the arrangement..."" which is clearly wrong. 

So conclusion: Sentence A is correct, B is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The subject of the sentence is **""The arrangement""** (singular), so the verb must agree in number.  
- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""is""** (singular verb) to match the singular subject.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""are""** (plural verb), which clashes with the singular subject.  

The phrase **""of the pyramids""** is a prepositional phrase modifying the subject but does not affect the verb's number. The core structure is:  
*The arrangement **is** a disputed representation...*  

Thus, **Sentence A** is correct, and **Sentence B** violates subject-verb agreement."
5,is,are,1,The arrangement of the pyramids is a disputed representation of the orion constellation in the orion correlation theory.,The arrangement of the pyramids are a disputed representation of the orion constellation in the orion correlation theory.,18,160,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about the arrangement of the pyramids and their relation to the Orion constellation in the Orion correlation theory. The main difference between them is the verb: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, the key here is to identify the subject of each sentence and determine if it's singular or plural.

Looking at both sentences, the subject is ""The arrangement of the pyramids."" The phrase ""of the pyramids"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""arrangement."" The main noun here is ""arrangement,"" which is singular. Even though ""pyramids"" is plural, the subject itself is singular because it's referring to the arrangement as a single entity.

So, the verb should agree with ""arrangement,"" which is singular. That means the correct verb should be ""is"" instead of ""are."" Therefore, Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is correct, while Sentence A uses ""are,"" which is incorrect because it's plural.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with collective nouns or when there's a prepositional phrase between the subject and verb. For example, in a sentence like ""The group of students is/are studying,"" both can be correct depending on dialect (British vs. American English). But in this case, ""arrangement"" is a singular noun, so it should definitely take ""is."" There's no collective noun ambiguity here.

Another thing to check: the rest of the sentence. The predicate is ""a disputed representation..."" which is singular. If the verb were plural ""are,"" the predicate would need to be plural, like ""disputed representations,"" but it's not. So that's another clue that ""is"" is correct.

Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""The arrangement of the pyramids""*. Here, the core noun is **""arrangement""** (singular), not ""pyramids"" (plural). The verb must agree with the singular subject, so the correct form is **""is""** (Sentence B).  

Sentence A incorrectly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural noun *""pyramids""*, but the pyramids are not the subject—they are part of a prepositional phrase (*""of the pyramids""*) modifying the singular subject *""arrangement""*.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Subject-verb agreement hinges on identifying the grammatical subject, not intervening plural nouns in prepositional phrases."
7,are,is,1,"The nearest inhabited places to this point are baker lake, nunavut well to the north, and arviat to the east.","The nearest inhabited places to this point is baker lake, nunavut well to the north, and arviat to the east.",20,377,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Both sentences are similar except for the verb: Sentence A uses ""are"" and Sentence B uses ""is"". 

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""The nearest inhabited places to this point"". The verb in Sentence A is ""are"", which is plural, and in Sentence B it's ""is"", which is singular. 

The key here is determining whether the subject is singular or plural. The subject is ""places"", which is plural. ""Inhabited"" is an adjective describing the noun ""places"", and ""nearest"" is a superlative adjective. So the main noun is ""places"", plural. Therefore, the verb should agree with a plural subject.

So, Sentence A uses ""are"", which is correct because it's plural. Sentence B uses ""is"", which is singular and doesn't agree with the plural subject ""places"". That makes Sentence B incorrect. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come after the subject. Let me double-check. The structure is ""The nearest inhabited places... are..."" followed by a list. The verb ""are"" is correctly matching the plural subject. Even though the list after the verb has singular place names, the verb is agreeing with the subject, not the predicate nominatives. 

For example, ""The places are X and Y."" Even if X and Y are singular, the verb still needs to agree with the plural subject ""places"". So Sentence A is correct. Sentence B is wrong because ""is"" doesn't agree with the plural subject. 

Another thing to check: sometimes the subject might be a singular noun phrase even if it seems plural. But in this case, ""places"" is definitely plural. So yes, ""are"" is correct. 

Also, looking at the capitalization: ""baker lake"", ""nunavut"", and ""arviat"" are proper nouns and should be capitalized. But the user's question is about grammaticality, which includes subject-verb agreement, not just capitalization. However, the user might not be asking about the capitalization errors, just the verb. But the original sentences have lowercase, which is incorrect. But since the user is focusing on which sentence is grammatical, the main issue here is the verb agreement. So even if the capitalization is wrong, the verb in Sentence A is correct, making it grammatical, while Sentence B is ungrammatical due to the verb. 

So the conclusion is Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""The nearest inhabited places""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Note:** Both sentences have capitalization errors (e.g., ""baker lake,"" ""nunavut,"" and ""arviat"" should be capitalized as proper nouns). However, the primary grammatical issue here is subject-verb agreement."
7,are,is,1,"The nearest inhabited places to this point are baker lake, nunavut well to the north, and arviat to the east.","The nearest inhabited places to this point is baker lake, nunavut well to the north, and arviat to the east.",20,377,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about the nearest inhabited places to a certain point. 

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb: Sentence A uses ""is"" while Sentence B uses ""are"". The subject in both cases is ""The nearest inhabited places to this point"". 

Now, the key here is subject-verb agreement. The subject is ""places"", which is plural. So, the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Are"" is the plural form of the verb ""to be"" in the present tense, and ""is"" is singular. Therefore, ""are"" should be correct here.

Looking at Sentence A: ""The nearest inhabited places... is..."" That's a problem because ""places"" is plural and ""is"" is singular. So that's a subject-verb disagreement. 

Sentence B uses ""are"", which matches the plural subject ""places"". So Sentence B should be correct. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes, even if the subject seems plural, there might be cases where it's considered singular. For example, if the subject is a collective noun or if the phrase is treated as a single entity. But in this case, ""inhabited places"" is clearly plural. There are two places mentioned: Baker Lake and Arviat. So the verb should definitely be plural. 

Also, checking the capitalization: Baker Lake and Arviat are proper nouns, so they should be capitalized. Nunavut is a territory, so it should also be capitalized. In both sentences, they are written in lowercase. That's an error, but the user is specifically asking about grammaticality related to the verb agreement. The question might not be focusing on the capitalization, but it's worth noting as an additional error. However, the main issue here is the verb. 

So, conclusion: Sentence B is grammatical because ""are"" agrees with the plural subject ""places"". Sentence A is ungrammatical because ""is"" doesn't agree.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""The nearest inhabited places""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
  - ✅ **Sentence B** correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject.  
  - ❌ **Sentence A** incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Proper nouns like **Baker Lake**, **Nunavut**, and **Arviat** should be capitalized in both sentences.  
- Commas are needed after **""Nunavut""** for clarity: *""Baker Lake, Nunavut, well to the north, and Arviat...""*  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
Plural subjects require plural verbs (e.g., *places **are***), and singular subjects require singular verbs (e.g., *place **is***)."
9,provides,provide,1,The sheltered courtyard space within the four main columns provides a large open space for waiting crowds.,The sheltered courtyard space within the four main columns provide a large open space for waiting crowds.,17,492,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are almost identical except for the verb ""provides"" in A and ""provide"" in B. The subject of the sentence is ""The sheltered courtyard space within the four main columns."" 

First, I need to figure out the subject-verb agreement here. The main verb is either ""provides"" or ""provide,"" so the key is to determine whether the subject is singular or plural.

Looking at Sentence A: ""The sheltered courtyard space within the four main columns provides..."" The subject here is ""space,"" which is singular. ""Sheltered courtyard"" is an adjective describing the space. Then there's a prepositional phrase ""within the four main columns."" Prepositional phrases usually don't affect the verb number. So the core subject is ""space,"" singular, so the verb should be ""provides."" That makes Sentence A correct.

Sentence B uses ""provide,"" which is plural. But since the subject is still ""space,"" which is singular, this would be incorrect. The confusion might come from the prepositional phrase mentioning ""four main columns,"" which is plural, but that doesn't change the subject. The columns are part of the location, not the subject itself.

Wait, but maybe someone could think that ""columns"" is the subject? Let me check again. The structure is ""The sheltered courtyard space [within the four main columns]..."" The part in brackets is a prepositional phrase modifying ""space."" So the main noun is ""space,"" singular. Therefore, the verb must agree with ""space,"" hence ""provides"" is correct. So Sentence A is grammatical, B is not.

Another way to test is to remove the prepositional phrase: ""The sheltered courtyard space provides..."" vs. ""The sheltered courtyard space provide..."" Clearly, the first is correct. So yes, A is correct, B is wrong.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A is grammatical.**  
- **Sentence B is ungrammatical.**  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""The sheltered courtyard space""** (singular), and the verb must agree with it. The prepositional phrase **""within the four main columns""** (plural) does not affect the verb's number. Since the subject is singular, the correct verb form is **""provides""** (Sentence A).  

Sentence B incorrectly uses **""provide""** (plural verb) to match the plural prepositional phrase, which is a common subject-verb agreement error."
9,provides,provide,1,The sheltered courtyard space within the four main columns provides a large open space for waiting crowds.,The sheltered courtyard space within the four main columns provide a large open space for waiting crowds.,17,492,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both talking about a sheltered courtyard space. The main difference between them is the verb: ""provide"" in Sentence A and ""provides"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of each sentence. The subject is crucial because it determines whether the verb should be singular or plural. Let's break down Sentence A: ""The sheltered courtyard space within the four main columns provide a large open space for waiting crowds."" The main clause here is ""The sheltered courtyard space... provide..."" So the subject is ""The sheltered courtyard space."" Now, ""space"" is a singular noun, so the subject is singular. Therefore, the verb should agree with a singular subject. ""Provide"" is the base form, which is plural. So that's a problem. The correct verb form should be ""provides"" for a singular subject. Hence, Sentence A is incorrect because the subject and verb don't agree in number.

Looking at Sentence B: ""The sheltered courtyard space within the four main columns provides a large open space for waiting crowds."" Here, the verb is ""provides,"" which is singular. Since the subject ""space"" is singular, the verb ""provides"" matches correctly. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatically correct.

Wait, but maybe there's a confusion here. Sometimes prepositional phrases can trick us. The phrase ""within the four main columns"" is a prepositional phrase modifying the subject. The rule is that the verb agrees with the subject, not with the noun in the prepositional phrase. So even though ""columns"" is plural, the subject is still ""space,"" which is singular. So the verb should indeed be singular. That confirms that Sentence B is correct, and A is wrong.

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. Remove the prepositional phrase: ""The sheltered courtyard space provides..."" vs. ""The sheltered courtyard space provide..."" Clearly, the second one is wrong. So yes, Sentence B is correct.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The subject of the sentence is **""The sheltered courtyard space""** (singular). The verb must agree with the singular subject, so the correct form is **""provides""** (singular).  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses **""provide""** (plural verb) for a singular subject.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses **""provides""** (singular verb).  

The phrase **""within the four main columns""** is a prepositional phrase modifying the subject but does not affect subject-verb agreement. The verb must always match the grammatical number of the subject itself.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
A singular subject takes a singular verb, even if it is followed by a prepositional phrase containing plural nouns."
20,is,are,1,"Midget and jason get into an argument, and midget informs jason that this is how life on the streets is.","Midget and jason get into an argument, and midget informs jason that this is how life on the streets are.",20,718,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both involving Midget and Jason arguing, and Midget explaining something about life on the streets. The key difference is the verb at the end: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to figure out the subject that the verb is referring to. The clause in question is ""this is how life on the streets is/are."" The main subject here is ""life on the streets."" So, ""life"" is the subject, and ""on the streets"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""life."" 

Now, ""life"" is a singular noun, so the verb should agree with a singular subject. That means the correct verb should be ""is,"" which is singular. In Sentence A, the verb is ""is,"" so that should be correct. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is plural, so that would be incorrect because it doesn't agree with the singular ""life.""

Wait, but maybe someone could think that ""streets"" is the subject because it's closer to the verb? But no, the structure is ""life on the streets,"" so ""life"" is still the main noun. The prepositional phrase ""on the streets"" just adds information about where the life is. The verb must agree with ""life,"" not ""streets.""

So, Sentence A is grammatical because ""is"" matches the singular ""life."" Sentence B is ungrammatical because ""are"" is plural and doesn't agree with the singular subject. 

I should also check if there are any other issues. The names ""Midget"" and ""jason"" should be capitalized since they're proper nouns. In both sentences, ""Midget"" is capitalized, but ""jason"" is lowercase. That's a mistake, but the user is focusing on the verb agreement, so maybe that's a separate issue. The main point here is the verb at the end. So, despite the capitalization error in ""jason,"" the key grammatical issue is the verb agreement. Therefore, Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The key difference lies in the verb agreement at the end of each sentence. The subject of the clause is **""life on the streets""**, where **""life""** (singular) is the core noun, and **""on the streets""** is a prepositional phrase modifying it. Since **""life""** is singular, the verb must agree with it, requiring the singular **""is""** (as in Sentence A).  

Sentence B incorrectly uses **""are""** (plural), which mistakenly agrees with the plural noun **""streets""** instead of the singular subject **""life""**. This violates subject-verb agreement rules.  

**Note:** Both sentences have inconsistent capitalization of the name **""jason""** (should be **""Jason""**), but this does not affect the grammaticality of the verb agreement in question."
20,is,are,1,"Midget and jason get into an argument, and midget informs jason that this is how life on the streets is.","Midget and jason get into an argument, and midget informs jason that this is how life on the streets are.",20,718,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about Midget and Jason arguing, and the key difference is the verb used in the clause ""this is how life on the streets are/is."" 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The main clause here is ""this is how life on the streets is/are."" The subject of the dependent clause is ""life on the streets."" The verb that follows should agree with the subject ""life."" 

Now, ""life"" is a singular noun. So the verb should be singular as well. That would mean ""is"" is correct. But wait, sometimes people get confused because of the prepositional phrase that comes after the subject. In this case, ""on the streets"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""life."" But the subject is still ""life,"" which is singular. So the verb should be ""is.""

Looking at Sentence A: ""...this is how life on the streets are."" That uses ""are,"" which is plural. Since the subject is singular, that's incorrect. Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is correct. 

But wait, maybe there's a trick here. Could ""streets"" be the subject? No, because the structure is ""life on the streets,"" so ""life"" is still the main noun. The phrase ""on the streets"" just describes where the life is. So the verb must agree with ""life,"" not ""streets.""

Another thing to check: sometimes in sentences like ""This is how things are,"" the verb agrees with ""things,"" which is plural. But in the given sentence, the structure is ""this is how life... is."" So ""life"" is singular. 

So Sentence A is ungrammatical because it uses ""are"" with a singular subject. Sentence B is correct with ""is.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the clause in question is *""life on the streets""*. Here, **""life""** is the singular subject, and the prepositional phrase *""on the streets""* merely describes it. The verb must agree with the singular subject **""life""**, so the correct form is **""is""** (as in Sentence B).  

Sentence A incorrectly uses **""are""**, which would only be appropriate if the subject were plural (e.g., *""These are how things on the streets are""*). Since the subject is singular, **Sentence A** violates subject-verb agreement.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Always ensure the verb matches the grammatical number of the subject, ignoring intervening prepositional phrases."

Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. Both are about the difference between primitive and other tasks. The main difference between them is the verb: Sentence A uses ""is"" and Sentence B uses ""are"". 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs. So, the key here is to identify the subject of the sentence. 

Looking at both sentences, the main clause is ""The difference between primitive and other tasks [is/are] that..."". The subject here is ""the difference"". ""Difference"" is a singular noun, so the verb should agree with it. That would mean using ""is"" instead of ""are"". 

But wait, sometimes people get confused when there's a prepositional phrase after the subject. In this case, ""between primitive and other tasks"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""difference"". The subject is still ""difference"", which is singular. So the verb should be ""is"".

Sentence A uses ""is"", which matches the singular subject. Sentence B uses ""are"", which would be incorrect because the subject is singular. 

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. Remove the prepositional phrase: ""The difference is that..."" vs. ""The difference are that..."". Clearly, ""is"" is correct here. 

So, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Explanation:  
The subject of the sentence is **""The difference""** (singular), so the verb must agree with it.  
- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""is""** (singular verb) to match the singular subject.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""are""** (plural verb), which clashes with the singular subject.  

The prepositional phrase **""between primitive and other tasks""** does not affect the verb agreement. The core structure is:  
*The difference [...] **is** that [...]*.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
A singular subject requires a singular verb, even if intervening phrases suggest plurality."
7,is,are,1,The difference between primitive and other tasks is that the primitive actions can be directly executed.,The difference between primitive and other tasks are that the primitive actions can be directly executed.,16,1077,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are about the difference between primitive and other tasks. 

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B. The subject of the sentence is ""The difference between primitive and other tasks."" 

Hmm, subject-verb agreement is key here. The subject is ""difference,"" which is singular. Even though there are multiple things being compared (primitive and other tasks), the main noun is ""difference,"" a singular noun. So the verb should agree with a singular subject. That means ""is"" would be correct, right?

Wait, let me double-check. Sometimes when there's a prepositional phrase after the subject, people might get confused. The phrase ""between primitive and other tasks"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""difference."" The verb should still agree with the subject ""difference,"" not the objects in the prepositional phrase. So ""is"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because it uses ""are,"" which is plural, with a singular subject.

But maybe someone could argue that ""primitive and other tasks"" are plural, making the verb plural. But no, the subject is still ""difference,"" which is singular. So the verb should be ""is."" Yeah, that makes sense. So Sentence B is correct.
</think>

The grammatical sentence is **Sentence B**, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""The difference between primitive and other tasks""*, which is singular (*difference* is the core noun). The verb must agree with the singular subject, so **""is""** (not ""are"") is correct.  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses **""are""** (plural verb) with a singular subject.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses **""is""** (singular verb) to match the singular subject.  

**Corrected Sentence:**  
*The difference between primitive and other tasks **is** that the primitive actions can be directly executed.*"
7,is,are,1,"Her record in her few years here is a user who has grown, and whose abilities and knowledge of policy have developed over the years.","Her record in her few years here are a user who has grown, and whose abilities and knowledge of policy have developed over the years.",25,1167,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about someone's record over a few years, using either ""is"" or ""are"" as the verb.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject in both sentences is ""Her record."" ""Record"" is singular, so the verb should agree with a singular subject. That means ""is"" would be correct, and ""are"" would be incorrect. So Sentence A uses ""is,"" which should be correct, and Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is wrong.

But wait, let me double-check. The sentence structure might be tricky. The sentence says ""Her record... is/are a user who has grown..."" Hmm, ""a user"" is a singular noun phrase here. If the subject is ""record,"" which is singular, then ""is a user"" makes sense. But does ""record"" being a user make sense? Maybe that's a separate issue, but the user is focusing on grammaticality, not logic. So even if the metaphor is odd, the grammar is about subject-verb agreement.

Another point: sometimes collective nouns can be tricky, but ""record"" is definitely singular. So ""are"" in Sentence B doesn't match. Therefore, Sentence A is correct, Sentence B is incorrect.

Wait, but the predicate after ""is/are"" is a bit complex. The sentence structure is ""Her record... is a user..."" which might be a metaphor, but grammatically, the verb should still agree with ""record."" So yes, ""is"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is *""Her record""* (singular), so the verb must agree with a singular subject.  
  - Sentence A correctly uses *""is""* (singular verb).  
  - Sentence B incorrectly uses *""are""* (plural verb), which clashes with the singular subject *""record.""*  

**Key Issue:**  
The error in Sentence B violates **subject-verb agreement**. Even though the predicate (*""a user who has grown...""*) is complex, the verb must always match the grammatical number of the subject (*""record""*).  

**Note:**  
While Sentence A is grammatically correct, the phrasing *""Her record... is a user""* is semantically odd (a ""record"" is not literally a ""user""). However, this is a stylistic or logical concern, not a grammatical one."
7,is,are,1,"Her record in her few years here is a user who has grown, and whose abilities and knowledge of policy have developed over the years.","Her record in her few years here are a user who has grown, and whose abilities and knowledge of policy have developed over the years.",25,1167,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about someone's record being a user who has grown, etc.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used: Sentence A uses ""are"" and Sentence B uses ""is"". The subject here is ""Her record"", which is singular. So, the verb should agree with the subject in number. 

Wait, ""record"" is singular, so the verb should be ""is"", right? That would make Sentence B correct. But let me check the rest of the sentence. The predicate after ""is"" is ""a user who has grown..."". Hmm, but does that make sense? A record is a user? That seems a bit off. Maybe there's a subject-verb agreement issue here, but also a problem with the sentence's meaning.

Wait, maybe the real issue is that ""record"" (singular) is being equated to ""a user"" (singular), which might not be logical. But the user's question is about grammaticality, not logic. So even if the sentence is a bit illogical, the grammar might still be correct. 

So, focusing on grammar: ""Her record... is a user..."" The verb ""is"" agrees with ""record"", which is correct. In Sentence A, ""are"" would be incorrect because ""record"" is singular. So Sentence B is grammatically correct, and Sentence A is not. 

But wait, maybe there's a compound subject I'm missing? Let me check again. The sentence structure is ""Her record... is/are a user..."". The subject is ""record"", so the verb should be ""is"". Therefore, Sentence B is correct. Sentence A uses ""are"", which doesn't agree with the singular subject. 

So the answer should be that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of subject-verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The subject of the sentence is **""Her record""** (singular), so the verb must agree in number.  
- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses **""are""** (plural verb) with the singular subject *""record""*.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses **""is""** (singular verb) to match the singular subject.  

### Additional Note:  
While the grammar in Sentence B is correct, the sentence itself is semantically odd. A *""record""* (a history of achievements) cannot logically be equated to a *""user""* (a person). A more natural phrasing might focus on the person directly, e.g., *""In her few years here, she has grown as a user, and her abilities and knowledge of policy have developed over the years.""*  

However, the question focuses on **grammaticality**, not logic or style. Thus, **Sentence B** is grammatically valid."
8,holds,hold,1,"However, random application of biologically active substances holds as many dangers as it does opportunities.","However, random application of biologically active substances hold as many dangers as it does opportunities.",15,1275,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are about the application of biologically active substances and whether it holds or hold dangers and opportunities.

First, I need to figure out the subject of each sentence. Both sentences start with ""However, random application of biologically active substances..."" The key difference is the verb: ""holds"" in Sentence A and ""hold"" in Sentence B. 

The main subject here is ""random application."" The phrase ""of biologically active substances"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""application."" So, the subject is singular because ""application"" is a singular noun. Therefore, the verb should agree with a singular subject. 

In Sentence A, ""holds"" is the third person singular form of the verb, which matches ""application."" That makes sense. Sentence B uses ""hold,"" which is plural. Since the subject is singular, ""hold"" would be incorrect. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come after the subject, like the prepositional phrase here. They might think the verb should agree with ""substances,"" which is plural. But no, the verb agrees with the subject, not the object of the preposition. So even though ""substances"" is plural, the subject is still ""application,"" so the verb should be singular. 

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. Remove the prepositional phrase: ""Random application holds..."" vs. ""Random application hold..."" Clearly, ""holds"" is correct. So Sentence A is grammatical, and B is not. 

I should also consider the structure after ""as many dangers as it does opportunities."" The ""it does"" refers back to the application, so ""it"" is singular, reinforcing that the verb should be singular. If the verb were plural, ""they do"" would be needed, but that's not the case here. 

So, putting it all together: Sentence A is correct because the singular subject ""application"" takes the singular verb ""holds."" Sentence B incorrectly uses the plural verb ""hold.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Explanation:  
The subject of the sentence is **""random application""** (singular noun). The verb must agree with the singular subject, so **""holds""** (singular) is correct.  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""holds""** to match the singular subject.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""hold""** (plural verb), which clashes with the singular subject.  

The phrase **""of biologically active substances""** is a prepositional phrase modifying ""application"" and does not affect subject-verb agreement. The pronoun **""it""** later in the sentence also reinforces the singular subject.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
Verbs must agree with their **subject** in number, not with intervening phrases or objects."
8,holds,hold,1,"However, random application of biologically active substances holds as many dangers as it does opportunities.","However, random application of biologically active substances hold as many dangers as it does opportunities.",15,1275,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: Sentence A or Sentence B. Both sentences are almost identical except for the verb ""hold"" vs. ""holds"". The key here is subject-verb agreement.

First, I need to identify the subject of the verb. The main clause in both sentences is about ""random application of biologically active substances"". The subject here is ""application"", which is singular. The phrase ""of biologically active substances"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""application"", so it doesn't affect the verb number. 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""hold"", which is plural. But since the subject is singular (""application""), the correct verb should be ""holds"". Therefore, Sentence A is incorrect because it uses a plural verb with a singular subject. Sentence B uses ""holds"", which agrees with the singular subject, making it correct.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come after the subject. For example, if the subject were ""biologically active substances"", which is plural, then ""hold"" would be correct. But in this case, the subject is ""application"", not ""substances"". So the verb must agree with ""application"", not the object of the preposition. 

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. Remove the prepositional phrase: ""However, random application holds..."" That makes it clear that ""holds"" is correct. So Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb ""hold/holds"" is **""random application""** (singular), not ""biologically active substances"" (plural). The prepositional phrase *""of biologically active substances""* modifies the subject but does not affect the verb's number.  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses **""hold""** (plural verb) with the singular subject ""application.""  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses **""holds""** (singular verb) to agree with the singular subject.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Verbs must agree with their **grammatical subject**, not with modifying phrases. Simplify the sentence to check:  
*""Random application holds...""* (correct) vs. *""Random application hold...""* (incorrect)."
21,are,is,1,"No, but there are no non-trivial mentions of the organisation cited anywhere, and the external links in the article are to self-published sources.","No, but there are no non-trivial mentions of the organisation cited anywhere, and the external links in the article is to self-published sources.",23,1304,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb used in the last part: Sentence A uses ""are"" and Sentence B uses ""is"". 

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The first part of both sentences is the same: ""No, but there are no non-trivial mentions of the organisation cited anywhere,"". Then they both have a conjunction ""and"" connecting the next part. The key difference is in the subject-verb agreement here.

In Sentence A: ""the external links in the article are to self-published sources."" The subject here is ""external links"", which is plural. The verb ""are"" agrees with the plural subject. That seems correct.

In Sentence B: ""the external links in the article is to self-published sources."" Here, the subject is still ""external links"" (plural), but the verb is ""is"" (singular). That's a subject-verb disagreement. The plural subject requires a plural verb, so ""are"" is correct, making Sentence B incorrect.

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here. Could ""external links"" be considered a singular noun in some context? No, ""links"" is definitely plural. The verb should be plural. So Sentence B is ungrammatical because it uses ""is"" instead of ""are"". 

Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is not. The error in B is a subject-verb agreement issue. The user might be testing understanding of plural vs. singular verbs with compound subjects or collective nouns, but in this case, ""links"" is clearly plural. So the answer should be that Sentence A is correct and B is incorrect.
</think>

**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The error in **Sentence B** lies in **subject-verb agreement**. The phrase *""the external links in the article""* has a plural subject (*links*), so the verb must also be plural (*are*). In Sentence B, the singular verb *""is""* incorrectly matches the plural subject *""links""*.  

**Sentence A** correctly uses *""are""* to agree with the plural subject *""links""*.  

**Key Issue**:  
- ✅ **Sentence A**: *""...external links... are...""* (plural subject + plural verb).  
- ❌ **Sentence B**: *""...external links... is...""* (plural subject + singular verb).  

Thus, **Sentence A** is grammatical, and **Sentence B** is not."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are almost identical except for the verb used in the last part: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to focus on the subject-verb agreement here. The sentence structure after ""and"" is crucial. The phrase in question is ""the external links in the article is/are to self-published sources."" The subject here is ""external links,"" which is plural. 

So, the verb should agree with the plural subject. ""Are"" is the plural form of the verb ""to be,"" while ""is"" is singular. Therefore, ""external links... are"" is correct, making Sentence B grammatical. Sentence A uses ""is,"" which doesn't agree with the plural subject ""links,"" so it's ungrammatical.

Wait, let me double-check. The subject is definitely ""external links,"" right? Yes, ""links"" is plural. So the verb should be ""are."" Yep, that's right. So Sentence B is correct, and A is incorrect. I don't see any other differences between the sentences. The rest of the structure seems the same. So the answer should be that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is not because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The error in Sentence A lies in subject-verb agreement. The subject ""external links"" (plural) requires the plural verb ""are,"" not the singular ""is."" Sentence B correctly uses ""are,"" matching the plural subject.  

- **Sentence A (ungrammatical):**  
  *""...the external links in the article* **is** *to self-published sources.""*  
  (Incorrect: ""links"" ≠ ""is"")  

- **Sentence B (grammatical):**  
  *""...the external links in the article* **are** *to self-published sources.""*  
  (Correct: ""links"" + ""are"" agree in number).  

The rest of both sentences is structurally identical and grammatically sound."
14,continues,continue,1,Some have been quarantined and others marked for recommendation; research of new worlds continues today.,Some have been quarantined and others marked for recommendation; research of new worlds continue today.,15,1737,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both very similar except for the verb after ""research of new worlds"": ""continues"" in A and ""continue"" in B.

First, I need to figure out the subject-verb agreement here. The subject in the second part of each sentence is ""research of new worlds."" The main noun here is ""research,"" which is singular. The phrase ""of new worlds"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""research."" So the verb should agree with the singular subject ""research.""

In sentence A, the verb is ""continues,"" which is singular. That makes sense because ""research"" is singular. In sentence B, the verb is ""continue,"" which is plural. That would be incorrect because the subject is singular. Therefore, sentence A is correct, and B is not.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with collective nouns or when the subject seems plural because of the prepositional phrase. For example, ""a group of students"" takes a singular verb because the main noun is ""group."" Similarly here, ""research"" is the main noun, so the verb should be singular. So yes, ""continues"" is correct. 

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. If we remove the prepositional phrase, it becomes ""research continues today."" That's clearly correct. If we used ""continue,"" it would be ""research continue today,"" which is wrong. So sentence B is ungrammatical because of the plural verb with a singular subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the second clause in both sentences is *""research of new worlds.""* The core noun here is **""research""** (singular), and the prepositional phrase *""of new worlds""* does not affect the verb's number.  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses the singular verb **""continues""** to agree with the singular subject *""research.""*  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses the plural verb **""continue,""** which clashes with the singular subject.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Verbs must agree in number with their grammatical subject, ignoring intervening prepositional phrases.  
✅ **Correct:** *Research ... continues.*  
❌ **Incorrect:** *Research ... continue.*"
14,continues,continue,1,Some have been quarantined and others marked for recommendation; research of new worlds continues today.,Some have been quarantined and others marked for recommendation; research of new worlds continue today.,15,1737,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are pretty similar except for the verb in the last part: ""continue"" versus ""continues"". 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the verb in question. The sentence structure is a bit complex with two independent clauses separated by a semicolon. The first part is ""Some have been quarantined and others marked for recommendation"" – that's clear. The second part is ""research of new worlds continue today"" in Sentence A and ""continues today"" in Sentence B.

So, the subject here is ""research of new worlds"". Let's break that down. The main noun is ""research"", which is singular. The phrase ""of new worlds"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""research"". In English, the verb must agree with the subject in number. Since ""research"" is singular, the verb should be singular as well. That would mean ""continues"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is not because it uses ""continue"", which is plural, with a singular subject.

Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. Could ""new worlds"" be the subject? No, because the structure is ""research of new worlds"", so ""research"" is the head noun. The prepositional phrase just adds more information about what the research is about. So the verb should definitely agree with ""research"", not ""worlds"". 

Another thing to check: sometimes collective nouns can be tricky, but ""research"" is a singular noun here. So yes, ""continues"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the second clause is *""research of new worlds""*. The head noun here is **""research""** (singular), so the verb must agree in number. The correct form is **""continues""** (singular), not **""continue""** (plural).  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses *""continue""* (plural verb) with the singular subject *""research""*.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses *""continues""* (singular verb) to match the singular subject.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
Verbs must agree with their subjects in number. Prepositional phrases (e.g., *""of new worlds""*) do not affect subject-verb agreement."
6,are,is,1,Keep bad sources and original research are not reasons to delete an article so long as subject is notable.,Keep bad sources and original research is not reasons to delete an article so long as subject is notable.,19,2078,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are similar but have slight differences in their structure. Let me break them down.

First, looking at Sentence A: ""Keep bad sources and original research are not reasons to delete an article so long as subject is notable."" The main clause here starts with ""Keep bad sources and original research are..."" Wait, ""Keep"" is a verb here, so the structure might be a bit off. The subject seems to be ""Keep bad sources and original research,"" which is a compound noun phrase. But ""are"" is the verb. However, ""Keep"" is in the base form, which might not be correct here. Maybe it should be a gerund or an infinitive? Let me think. If the subject is an action, like ""keeping,"" then using the gerund form would make sense. So ""Keeping bad sources and original research are..."" would be correct. But in Sentence A, it's ""Keep,"" which is the base form, so that might be a problem. The verb ""are"" is plural, which matches the compound subject if both ""keeping bad sources"" and ""original research"" are considered as two separate reasons. But since the verb is ""are,"" it's plural, but the subject starts with ""Keep,"" which is a verb, not a noun. That might be the issue here. The subject should be a noun phrase, not a verb phrase. So maybe Sentence A is ungrammatical because the subject isn't properly formed.

Now, looking at Sentence B: ""Keep bad sources and original research is not reasons to delete an article so long as subject is notable."" Here, the main clause is ""Keep bad sources and original research is..."" The verb here is ""is,"" which is singular. But the subject is a compound of two things: ""Keep bad sources"" and ""original research."" If the subject is plural, the verb should be ""are,"" but in Sentence B, it's ""is,"" which is singular. That seems like a subject-verb agreement issue. However, maybe the writer intended the entire phrase ""Keep bad sources and original research"" as a single concept, hence using ""is."" But even then, ""is"" doesn't agree with the plural ""reasons."" Wait, the structure here is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. The main verb is ""is not reasons,"" which is incorrect because ""is"" is singular and ""reasons"" is plural. So ""is not reasons"" is ungrammatical. The correct form would be ""are not reasons."" But in Sentence B, the verb is ""is,"" which is singular, conflicting with the plural subject (if the subject is indeed plural). However, the subject in Sentence B is ""Keep bad sources and original research,"" which might be considered a single entity, but that's a stretch. Also, ""is not reasons"" is a problem because ""is"" requires a singular complement, but ""reasons"" is plural. So ""is not a reason"" would be correct if it's singular. But the sentence uses ""is not reasons,"" which is wrong. 

Wait, but both sentences have issues. Let me check again. Sentence A: ""Keep... are not reasons."" The subject is ""Keep bad sources and original research,"" which is a compound subject. If ""Keep bad sources"" is a noun phrase (like the act of keeping bad sources) and ""original research"" is another noun phrase, then together they form a plural subject, so ""are"" would be correct. But the problem is that ""Keep"" is a verb, not a noun. So ""Keeping bad sources"" would be the correct noun phrase. Therefore, Sentence A is incorrect because it uses ""Keep"" instead of ""Keeping."" 

Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is singular, but the subject is still the same compound, so it should be plural. Additionally, ""is not reasons"" is incorrect because ""is"" doesn't agree with ""reasons."" So Sentence B has two issues: the verb ""is"" doesn't agree with the plural subject, and ""is not reasons"" is incorrect. 

Therefore, both sentences have grammatical errors, but maybe one is less incorrect than the other. Wait, but the user is asking which is grammatical and which isn't. Let me think again. 

In Sentence A, the main issue is using ""Keep"" instead of ""Keeping."" If we correct that to ""Keeping bad sources and original research are not reasons...,"" then it's correct. But as written, ""Keep"" is a verb, making the subject a verb phrase, which is not appropriate. So the subject is incorrect. 

In Sentence B, the verb ""is"" doesn't agree with the plural subject (if the subject is considered plural). However, if the subject is intended to be a single concept, maybe ""Keeping bad sources and original research"" as a single reason, then ""is"" could work, but ""is not reasons"" would still be wrong. It should be ""is not a reason."" So even if the subject is singular, ""is not reasons"" is incorrect. 

Therefore, both sentences are ungrammatical, but perhaps the user expects one to be correct. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the structure again. 

The intended meaning is that both ""bad sources"" and ""original research"" are not reasons to delete an article. So the subject is ""bad sources and original research,"" and the verb should be plural. But in both sentences, the structure is different. 

Wait, actually, in both sentences, the subject is ""Keep bad sources and original research."" The word ""Keep"" is part of the subject. So maybe the user is trying to say that the act of keeping bad sources and original research is not a reason to delete the article. But the way it's phrased is confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe ""Keep"" is an imperative verb, making the sentence a command: ""Keep bad sources and original research,"" but then the rest of the sentence doesn't make sense. That can't be right. 

So the correct structure should be using a gerund for the subject: ""Keeping bad sources and original research are not reasons..."" So Sentence A uses ""Keep"" instead of ""Keeping,"" making it ungrammatical. Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is singular, but the subject is plural, and ""is not reasons"" is incorrect. 

Therefore, neither sentence is correct, but if I have to choose which is more grammatical, maybe Sentence A is closer because it uses ""are,"" which agrees with a plural subject, even though the subject is incorrectly formed. Sentence B has more errors. 

But the user is asking which is grammatical and which isn't. So perhaps the answer is that both are ungrammatical, but the intended correct version would be ""Keeping bad sources and original research are not reasons..."" So Sentence A is incorrect because of ""Keep,"" and Sentence B is incorrect because of ""is"" and ""reasons."" 

Alternatively, maybe the user considers that ""Keep"" is part of a noun phrase, like a policy named ""Keep bad sources and original research,"" in which case it's a singular subject. But that's a stretch. 

In standard grammar, the correct form would be using gerunds. Therefore, Sentence A is incorrect because of ""Keep,"" and Sentence B is incorrect because of ""is"" and ""reasons."" So neither is correct, but the user might expect that one is correct. Maybe the answer is that Sentence B is ungrammatical because of ""is not reasons,"" and Sentence A is also ungrammatical because of ""Keep"" instead of ""Keeping."" 

But perhaps the user considers that ""Keep"" is part of a compound subject with ""original research,"" making the subject plural, so ""are"" is correct. But ""Keep"" as a verb in the subject is wrong. So Sentence A is ungrammatical because of ""Keep,"" and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of ""is"" and ""reasons."" 

Therefore, the answer is that both are ungrammatical, but if forced to choose, Sentence A has a subject-verb agreement error (plural subject with ""are"" but incorrect verb form due to ""Keep""), and Sentence B has a subject-verb agreement error (singular ""is"" with plural subject) and ""is not reasons"" is incorrect. 

But the user might expect that one is correct. Let me check again. 

Wait, maybe the structure is different. The sentence could be parsed as ""Keep [bad sources and original research] are not reasons..."" where ""Keep"" is an imperative verb, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, ""Keep bad sources and original research"" is the subject, but ""Keep"" is a noun here, which is not standard. 

Alternatively, maybe ""Keep"" is a typo for ""Keeping."" If that's the case, then Sentence A would be correct. But as written, ""Keep"" is incorrect. 

So the conclusion is that both sentences are ungrammatical, but the user might expect that Sentence B is ungrammatical because of ""is not reasons,"" and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of ""Keep"" instead of ""Keeping."" Therefore, the answer is that both are ungrammatical, but if the user wants to know which is more correct, perhaps neither. However, the likely intended answer is that Sentence B is ungrammatical because of ""is"" and ""reasons,"" and Sentence A is also ungrammatical because of ""Keep,"" but maybe the user thinks one is correct. 

Wait, perhaps the user is testing subject-verb agreement. In Sentence A, the subject is ""Keep bad sources and original research,"" which is plural (two things), so ""are"" is correct. But ""Keep"" is a verb, so the subject is not a noun phrase. In Sentence B, the same subject is treated as singular with ""is,"" which is incorrect. So the main issue is that the subject in both sentences is not a proper noun phrase. Therefore, both are ungrammatical. But if we ignore the ""Keep"" issue and focus on subject-verb agreement, Sentence A uses ""are"" which would be correct for a plural subject, while Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is incorrect. However, the actual problem is that the subject is not a noun phrase. 

Alternatively, maybe ""Keep bad sources and original research"" is intended as a noun phrase, like a title or a policy, in which case it's singular. But then Sentence B would have ""is not reasons,"" which is still wrong. 

I think the correct answer is that both sentences are ungrammatical, but the user might expect that Sentence A is ungrammatical because of ""Keep"" and Sentence B because of ""is"" and ""reasons."" However, the user might have a different perspective. 

Alternatively, maybe ""Keep"" is part of a compound subject where ""Keep bad sources"" is a noun phrase (like a policy) and ""original research"" is another, making the subject plural. Then ""are"" would be correct. But ""Keep"" as a noun is not standard. 

In conclusion, the most accurate answer is that both sentences are ungrammatical. However, if the user expects one to be correct, perhaps Sentence A is considered grammatical despite the ""Keep"" issue, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, the correct answer is that neither is grammatical, but the user might not accept that. 

Wait, looking at the original sentences again:

Sentence A: ""Keep bad sources and original research are not reasons to delete an article so long as subject is notable.""

Sentence B: ""Keep bad sources and original research is not reasons to delete an article so long as subject is notable.""

Another error in both is ""subject is notable"" without an article. It should be ""the subject is notable.""

So both sentences have ""subject is notable"" instead of ""the subject is notable."" That's another error. But the user is focusing on the first part. 

So considering all errors:

Sentence A: Incorrect subject (""Keep"" instead of ""Keeping""), but correct verb ""are"" for plural. Also missing ""the"" before ""subject.""

Sentence B: Incorrect verb ""is"" for plural subject, ""is not reasons"" (should be ""are not reasons""), and missing ""the"" before ""subject.""

Therefore, both are ungrammatical, but if we focus on the main clause, Sentence A has a subject-verb agreement error because the subject is not a proper noun phrase, while Sentence B has a subject-verb agreement error and a complement agreement error (""is not reasons""). 

The user might consider that Sentence A is ungrammatical because of ""Keep"" and Sentence B because of ""is"" and ""reasons."" So the answer is that both are ungrammatical, but the specific reasons differ. However, the user asks which is grammatical and which isn't. Since both have errors, but perhaps Sentence A is more correct in using ""are,"" even with the wrong subject form, while Sentence B is worse. 

Alternatively, the answer is that neither is grammatical, but the user might expect that one is. 

Given the options, I think the intended answer is that Sentence B is ungrammatical because of ""is not reasons"" and subject-verb disagreement, while Sentence A is also ungrammatical because of ""Keep"" instead of ""Keeping."" But since the user asks which is grammatical, maybe the answer is that neither is correct. However, the user might have intended one to be correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user considers that ""Keep"" is part of a compound subject with ""original research,"" making the subject plural, so ""are"" is correct. But ""Keep"" as a verb in the subject is incorrect. 

In conclusion, the answer is that both sentences are ungrammatical. However, if forced to choose, Sentence A is incorrect due to ""Keep"" and Sentence B due to ""is"" and ""reasons."" But the user might expect that one is correct. 

Wait, maybe the user is testing whether the verb should agree with the compound subject. In Sentence A, ""Keep... and original research"" is plural, so ""are"" is correct. But the subject is not a noun phrase. In Sentence B, ""is"" is incorrect. So if we ignore the ""Keep"" issue, Sentence A would be correct. But since ""Keep"" is a verb, the subject is not properly formed. 

Therefore, the answer is that Sentence A is ungrammatical because the subject is a verb phrase, and Sentence B is also ungrammatical because of subject-verb disagreement and ""is not reasons."" 

But the user might not consider the ""Keep"" issue and focus on the verb agreement. In that case, Sentence A uses ""are"" correctly for a plural subject, while Sentence B uses ""is"" incorrectly. However, the subject in Sentence A is not a proper noun phrase. 

Given that, the answer is that both are ungrammatical, but if the user is only focusing on subject-verb agreement, Sentence A is correct in using ""are"" and Sentence B is incorrect. But given the actual structure, both are wrong. 

I think the correct answer is that both sentences are ungrammatical. However, the user might expect that one is correct. Given the options, perhaps the answer is that Sentence A is ungrammatical because of ""Keep"" and Sentence B is also ungrammatical because of ""is"" and ""reasons."" 

But to sum up, the main issues are:

Sentence A: Incorrect subject (verb instead of gerund), missing ""the"" before ""subject.""

Sentence B: Subject-verb disagreement, ""is not reasons,"" missing ""the.""

Therefore, both are ungrammatical. But the user might want to know which is more correct. If I have to choose, maybe Sentence A is less incorrect because ""are"" agrees with a plural subject, even though the subject is formed incorrectly. Sentence B has more errors. 

But the answer should be that both are ungrammatical. However, the user's question implies that one is grammatical and one isn't. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is that Sentence B is ungrammatical because of ""is not reasons,"" and Sentence A is also ungrammatical but for a different reason. 

Alternatively, maybe the user considers that ""Keep"" is part of a noun phrase, making the subject plural, so Sentence A is correct. But that's not standard. 

Given the confusion, I think the safest answer is that both sentences are ungrammatical, but if the user insists on choosing, Sentence A is ungrammatical due to ""Keep"" and Sentence B due to ""is"" and ""reasons."" However, the correct version would be ""Keeping bad sources and original research are not reasons to delete an article so long as the subject is notable.""
</think>

Both sentences have grammatical issues, but here's the breakdown:

**Sentence A**:  
*""Keep bad sources and original research are not reasons to delete an article so long as subject is notable.""*  
- **Issue 1**: The subject ""Keep bad sources and original research"" uses the base verb ""Keep"" instead of the gerund ""**Keeping**,"" which is required to form a noun phrase (e.g., ""Keeping bad sources..."").  
- **Issue 2**: Missing the definite article ""**the**"" before ""subject"" (*""so long as **the** subject is notable""*).  

**Sentence B**:  
*""Keep bad sources and original research is not reasons to delete an article so long as subject is notable.""*  
- **Issue 1**: Subject-verb disagreement. The compound subject (""Keep bad sources and original research"") is plural, but the verb ""**is**"" is singular.  
- **Issue 2**: ""Is not reasons"" is ungrammatical. The plural ""reasons"" clashes with the singular verb ""is.""  
- **Issue 3**: Missing ""**the**"" before ""subject.""  

### Conclusion:
- **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical** due to the incorrect verb form (""Keep"" instead of ""Keeping"") and missing article.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical** due to subject-verb disagreement (""is"" vs. plural subject) and ""is not reasons.""  

**Corrected Version**:  
*""Keeping bad sources and original research **are** not reasons to delete an article so long as **the** subject is notable.""*"

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are about whether bad sources and original research are reasons to delete an article, provided the subject is notable.

First, I need to look at the structure of each sentence. Let's start with Sentence A: ""Keep bad sources and original research is not reasons to delete an article so long as subject is notable."" The main clause here is ""Keep bad sources and original research is not reasons..."" Wait, the subject here seems to be ""Keep bad sources and original research,"" but the verb is ""is,"" which is singular. That might be a problem because if the subject is two things (bad sources and original research), the verb should be plural. So ""are"" instead of ""is."" Also, ""reasons"" is plural, so the verb should agree with that. So ""are not reasons"" would be correct. But in Sentence A, it's ""is not reasons,"" which is a disagreement in number. So that's a mistake.

Now, looking at Sentence B: ""Keep bad sources and original research are not reasons to delete an article so long as subject is notable."" Here, the verb is ""are,"" which matches the plural subject. So ""bad sources and original research"" are two reasons, so plural. That part seems correct. However, the beginning of the sentence says ""Keep..."" which might be an issue. Wait, the structure here is a bit confusing. Is ""Keep"" part of the subject? Let me parse it again. 

Wait, maybe ""Keep"" is being used as a noun here, like a policy or guideline named ""Keep."" But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo. Wait, the original sentences might have a typo. Let me check again. The user wrote: ""Keep bad sources and original research is not reasons..."" Maybe ""Keep"" is a verb, like an imperative? But that would make the sentence structure odd. For example, ""Keep bad sources and original research"" as a command, followed by ""is not reasons..."" which doesn't connect properly. That would make the sentence a run-on or a fragment. 

Alternatively, maybe ""Keep"" is part of a noun phrase. Wait, perhaps it's supposed to be ""The fact that there are bad sources and original research is not reasons..."" but that's not what's written. The way it's structured now, ""Keep"" is a verb, so the sentence starts with an imperative verb, then ""and"" connects another noun phrase, but then the verb ""is"" doesn't fit. So maybe the user intended ""Keeping"" instead of ""Keep""? If it were ""Keeping bad sources and original research,"" that would be a gerund phrase acting as a singular subject, but then the verb would need to be ""is,"" but the rest of the sentence has ""reasons,"" which is plural. So that would still be a problem. 

Wait, maybe the user meant ""The presence of bad sources and original research is not reasons..."" but again, that's not what's written. So in Sentence A, the structure is flawed because ""Keep"" is a verb, leading into a compound subject that's not properly connected. Then the verb ""is"" doesn't agree with the plural subject. 

In Sentence B, the verb is ""are,"" which does agree with the plural subject. However, the initial ""Keep"" is still a problem. If ""Keep"" is part of the subject, maybe it's a typo for ""Keeping,"" but as written, ""Keep"" is a verb. So both sentences have issues with the initial word ""Keep."" But assuming that ""Keep"" is a mistake and should be ""Keeping"" or ""The keep,"" but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe ""Keep"" is part of a title or a specific term, but that's unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe ""Keep"" is being used as a noun, but that's not standard. So perhaps both sentences have an error with ""Keep,"" but focusing on the subject-verb agreement, Sentence A uses ""is"" with a plural subject, which is wrong. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is correct for a plural subject, but the initial ""Keep"" is still problematic. 

Wait, but maybe ""Keep"" is part of the subject. Let's parse the sentences again. Sentence A: ""Keep bad sources and original research is not reasons..."" If ""Keep"" is part of the subject, then the subject would be ""Keep bad sources and original research,"" which is a compound noun phrase. But ""Keep"" here would need to be a noun, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the intended subject is ""bad sources and original research,"" but the word ""Keep"" is incorrectly placed. 

Alternatively, maybe ""Keep"" is a typo for ""Keeping,"" which would make the subject a gerund phrase: ""Keeping bad sources and original research is not reasons..."" But even then, ""is"" would be correct for a singular subject, but ""reasons"" is plural, so it should be ""are not reasons."" Wait, no. If the subject is singular (the act of keeping), then the verb should be ""is,"" but the complement is ""reasons,"" which is plural. But in English, the verb agrees with the subject, not the complement. So ""Keeping... is not reasons"" would be correct in structure, but semantically odd because ""is"" would pair with a singular complement. For example, ""Keeping them is not a reason."" But here, it's ""is not reasons,"" which is incorrect. So ""are"" would be needed if the complement is plural. Wait, no. The verb must agree with the subject, not the complement. So even if the complement is plural, the verb is determined by the subject. For example, ""The problem is the mistakes."" Here, ""problem"" is singular, so ""is,"" even though ""mistakes"" is plural. So in that case, ""Keeping... is not reasons"" would be grammatically correct if the subject is singular. But in Sentence A, the subject is ""Keep bad sources and original research,"" which is not a gerund, so it's not a singular subject. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down again. 

In Sentence A: The structure is ""Keep [X] and [Y] is not reasons..."" Here, ""Keep"" is a verb, so the sentence is a command to keep X and Y, followed by ""is not reasons..."" which is a separate clause. But that creates a run-on sentence. It's two independent clauses joined by ""and"" without proper punctuation. So ""Keep bad sources and original research"" is a command, and then ""is not reasons..."" is another clause, but they're connected incorrectly. So that's a grammatical error. 

In Sentence B: ""Keep bad sources and original research are not reasons..."" Here, ""are"" agrees with the plural subject. But again, ""Keep"" is a verb, so the structure is a command followed by ""are not reasons..."" which is also a run-on. So both sentences have a problem with the initial verb ""Keep"" creating a sentence fragment or run-on. 

Wait, maybe the user intended ""Keeping"" instead of ""Keep."" If that's the case, then ""Keeping bad sources and original research"" is a gerund phrase acting as the subject. Then, in Sentence A: ""Keeping... is not reasons..."" which would have a singular subject (""Keeping"") and singular verb ""is,"" but the complement is plural ""reasons."" However, subject-verb agreement is about the subject and verb, not the complement. So ""Keeping... is not reasons"" would be grammatically correct in terms of agreement, but ""reasons"" as a complement might be awkward. However, in Sentence B: ""Keeping... are not reasons..."" which would be incorrect because the subject is singular, so the verb should be ""is."" 

But the original sentences have ""Keep"" not ""Keeping."" So perhaps the user made a typo. If we assume that ""Keep"" is a mistake and should be ""Keeping,"" then Sentence A would have ""is"" (correct for singular subject) but ""reasons"" (plural complement), which is acceptable. Sentence B would have ""are"" (incorrect for singular subject). But since the original sentences use ""Keep,"" which is a verb, the sentences are structured as commands followed by a separate clause, leading to run-on sentences. 

Alternatively, maybe ""Keep"" is part of the subject. For example, if ""Keep"" is a noun (which it can be, like a fortress), but that doesn't fit here. So perhaps the sentences are both ungrammatical because of the initial ""Keep."" However, the user is asking which is grammatical. So maybe the key difference is the subject-verb agreement. 

Looking again: In Sentence A, the main clause after ""Keep..."" is ""is not reasons,"" which uses a singular verb with a plural subject (if the subject is ""bad sources and original research""). But if ""Keep"" is a verb, then the subject of the second clause is ""bad sources and original research,"" making the verb ""are"" necessary. However, the structure is confused because ""Keep"" is a verb, leading into a list, then ""is not reasons."" So the sentence is a mess. 

In Sentence B, the verb is ""are,"" which would agree with the plural subject, but again, the structure is problematic because ""Keep"" is a verb. So perhaps both sentences are ungrammatical, but the key difference is the subject-verb agreement. If we ignore the initial ""Keep"" issue and focus on the main clause, then Sentence B uses ""are"" correctly with a plural subject, while Sentence A uses ""is"" incorrectly. 

But the initial ""Keep"" is part of the sentence. So maybe the intended structure is that ""Keep"" is part of the subject. For example, if ""Keep"" is a noun (which is possible but unusual), then ""Keep bad sources and original research"" would be the subject. But ""Keep"" as a noun would mean a stronghold, which doesn't make sense here. So that's unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe ""Keep"" is part of a compound subject with ""bad sources and original research,"" but that's not how it's structured. The sentence is written as ""Keep bad sources and original research is/are..."" which is confusing. 

Given that, perhaps the main issue is the subject-verb agreement. If we consider that the subject is ""bad sources and original research,"" then the verb should be ""are."" So Sentence B is correct in that aspect, even though the initial ""Keep"" is problematic. But if ""Keep"" is a verb, then the sentence is a command followed by a clause that doesn't connect properly. 

Alternatively, maybe ""Keep"" is a typo for ""Keeping,"" making the subject a gerund phrase. In that case, Sentence A would have ""is"" (correct for singular subject) but ""reasons"" as a plural complement. Sentence B would have ""are"" (incorrect for singular subject). But since the original uses ""Keep,"" not ""Keeping,"" that's speculative. 

In conclusion, the key difference is the verb ""is"" vs. ""are."" Since the subject is plural (""bad sources and original research""), the verb should be ""are."" Therefore, Sentence B is correct in terms of subject-verb agreement, even though the sentence structure with ""Keep"" is awkward. Sentence A uses ""is,"" which is incorrect. However, the initial ""Keep"" might make both sentences ungrammatical, but the main point of the question is likely the subject-verb agreement. So the answer is that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Key Analysis:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - The subject of the sentence is the compound noun phrase *""bad sources and original research""* (plural).  
   - **Sentence A** incorrectly uses the singular verb *""is""* with a plural subject.  
   - **Sentence B** correctly uses the plural verb *""are""* to agree with the plural subject.  

2. **Structural Issues**:  
   - Both sentences begin with *""Keep""* (likely a typo for *""Keeping""* or *""The presence of""*), which creates ambiguity. However, focusing on the core clause (*""bad sources and original research [...] are/is not reasons""*), Sentence B adheres to grammatical rules.  

3. **Minor Errors**:  
   - Both sentences omit the definite article before *""subject""* (should be *""the subject""*). However, this does not affect the primary grammatical distinction between the two.  

**Conclusion**: Sentence B is grammatically correct due to proper subject-verb agreement, while Sentence A is ungrammatical."
8,are,is,1,"Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl phosphate and l-lysine, whereas its two products are phosphate and n6-acetyl-l-lysine.","Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme is acetyl phosphate and l-lysine, whereas its two products are phosphate and n6-acetyl-l-lysine.",20,3037,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb used in the first part: Sentence A uses ""are"" and Sentence B uses ""is"". 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""the two substrates of this enzyme"". The word ""substrates"" is plural, so the verb should agree with a plural subject. That means ""are"" is correct. Sentence A uses ""are"", which matches the plural subject. Sentence B uses ""is"", which is singular, so that's incorrect.

Wait, let me double-check. The structure is ""the two substrates... are..."" because ""two substrates"" is plural. If the subject were singular, like ""the substrate"", then ""is"" would be right. But here it's definitely plural. So Sentence B is wrong because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject. 

The rest of both sentences look the same. The second part of each sentence uses ""are"" with ""two products"", which is correct. So the error is only in the first part of Sentence B. 

I should also check if there's any other possible confusion. Maybe someone might think the subject is ""enzyme"", but no, the subject is ""substrates"". The phrase ""of this enzyme"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""substrates"", so it doesn't affect the verb. 

So the conclusion is Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- In Sentence A, the verb ""are"" correctly agrees with the plural subject ""the two substrates.""  
- In Sentence B, the verb ""is"" incorrectly disagrees with the plural subject ""the two substrates.""  

The error in Sentence B violates the rule of **subject-verb agreement** (plural subjects require plural verbs). The rest of both sentences is structurally correct."
8,are,is,1,"Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl phosphate and l-lysine, whereas its two products are phosphate and n6-acetyl-l-lysine.","Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme is acetyl phosphate and l-lysine, whereas its two products are phosphate and n6-acetyl-l-lysine.",20,3037,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about enzyme substrates and products.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used in the first part. Sentence A uses ""is"" while Sentence B uses ""are"". The subject in both cases is ""the two substrates of this enzyme"". 

Now, the key here is subject-verb agreement. The subject is plural because it's referring to ""two substrates"". So the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Are"" is the plural form, so Sentence B should be correct. Sentence A uses ""is"", which is singular, so that would be incorrect. 

Let me double-check. The subject is ""substrates"", which is plural. The verb needs to be plural as well. ""Are"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the mismatch between the plural subject and the singular verb ""is"". 

I should also check the rest of the sentences to make sure there aren't other issues, but the main problem is the subject-verb agreement. The rest of the sentence structure looks okay. The second part of both sentences uses ""are"" for ""two products"", which is correct. So yeah, the only error is in Sentence A's verb.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence B** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject ""the two substrates"" is plural, so the verb must agree in number. Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb ""is"" (""the two substrates ... **is**""), while Sentence B correctly uses the plural verb ""are"" (""the two substrates ... **are**""). The rest of both sentences is grammatically correct.  

**Key Issue:**  
Subject-verb agreement (""two substrates"" → plural → ""are"")."
19,are,is,1,"Fischer seems to have been of bohemian origin, possibly born at schönfeld, but details about his life are sketchy.","Fischer seems to have been of bohemian origin, possibly born at schönfeld, but details about his life is sketchy.",19,3585,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Both are almost the same except for the verb in the last clause: ""are sketchy"" vs. ""is sketchy"". 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs. So, looking at the last part of each sentence: ""details about his life are sketchy"" versus ""details about his life is sketchy"".

The subject here is ""details"". Let me check if ""details"" is singular or plural. ""Details"" ends with an 's', which usually indicates plural. The singular form would be ""detail"". So ""details"" is plural. Therefore, the verb should agree with a plural subject. The plural form of the verb ""to be"" in present tense is ""are"", and the singular is ""is"".

So in sentence A, ""are sketchy"" matches the plural subject ""details"", so that should be correct. Sentence B uses ""is sketchy"", which is singular, so that would be incorrect because the subject is plural. 

Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. Could ""details"" be considered a collective noun or something else? Hmm, no, ""details"" is definitely plural. Collective nouns like ""group"" or ""team"" can sometimes take singular verbs, but ""details"" is straightforward plural. So ""details are"" is correct, ""details is"" is wrong. 

Therefore, sentence A is grammatical, and sentence B is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement. I should also check if there are any other differences, but the rest of the sentences look the same. ""Possibly born at schönfeld"" – note that ""Schönfeld"" should probably be capitalized since it's a proper noun (a place name), but maybe the user didn't capitalize it intentionally. However, the user's main focus is on the verb agreement, so that's the key point here.

Another thing to consider: sometimes in English, when the subject is a phrase like ""details about his life"", the head noun is ""details"", which is plural. So the verb must agree with ""details"", not with ""life"". So even though ""life"" is singular, the subject is ""details"", so plural verb. 

So yes, sentence B is incorrect because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject. Therefore, the answer is that sentence A is grammatical and sentence B is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- In Sentence A, the verb **""are""** correctly agrees with the plural subject **""details""** (plural subject + plural verb).  
- In Sentence B, the verb **""is""** incorrectly disagrees with the plural subject **""details""** (plural subject + singular verb).  

**Key Issue:**  
The error in Sentence B violates **subject-verb agreement**, a fundamental grammatical rule in English. The plural noun ""details"" requires the plural verb ""are,"" not the singular ""is.""  

**Note:**  
The word ""Schönfeld"" should also be capitalized as it is a proper noun (a place name), but this was likely omitted intentionally in the example. The primary focus here is the verb agreement."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. Both are almost the same except for the verb in the last part: ""is"" in A and ""are"" in B.

First, I need to look at the subject-verb agreement. The subject in question is ""details about his life."" The word ""details"" is plural, so the verb should agree with that. In sentence A, the verb is ""is,"" which is singular. That doesn't match. In sentence B, the verb is ""are,"" which is plural. So B should be correct because ""are"" matches the plural subject ""details.""

Wait, let me double-check. The structure is ""details... is sketchy"" vs. ""details... are sketchy."" Since ""details"" are multiple pieces of information, they require a plural verb. ""Are"" is correct here. So sentence B is grammatical, and A is not because it uses the singular ""is"" with a plural subject.

Another thing to check: sometimes collective nouns can be tricky, but ""details"" is clearly plural. No exceptions here. So yes, sentence B is correct. The user might be confused because sometimes people make mistakes with subject-verb agreement when the subject is separated by a prepositional phrase like ""about his life."" But the key is that the main subject is ""details,"" not ""life."" So the verb should agree with ""details,"" which is plural. Therefore, ""are"" is correct.

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb in the final clause is **""details about his life""**, which is plural. The verb must agree in number with the subject:  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb **""is""** (*""details... is sketchy""*).  
- Sentence B correctly uses the plural verb **""are""** (*""details... are sketchy""*).  

The error in Sentence A violates **subject-verb agreement**, a core grammatical rule."
7,websites,website,1,"A lot of the citations, namely websites, lack access dates and for the magazines, i would include issn numbers.","A lot of the citations, namely website, lack access dates and for the magazines, i would include issn numbers.",19,4141,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are pretty similar, but there are a couple of differences. 

First, looking at Sentence A: ""A lot of the citations, namely websites, lack access dates and for the magazines, i would include issn numbers."" Then Sentence B: ""A lot of the citations, namely website, lack access dates and for the magazines, i would include issn numbers."" The main difference is ""websites"" vs. ""website"" after ""namely."" 

I remember that after phrases like ""namely,"" you need to use a noun that matches in number with what it's referring to. The original noun here is ""citations,"" which is plural. So ""namely"" should introduce examples that are also plural. In Sentence A, ""websites"" is plural, which matches. Sentence B uses ""website,"" singular, which doesn't agree with the plural ""citations."" That makes Sentence B incorrect here.

Another thing to check: the pronoun ""i"" in both sentences. In English, the first-person singular pronoun should be capitalized. Both sentences have ""i"" lowercase, which is a mistake. However, the user's question is about which sentence is grammatical, so maybe they're focusing on the ""websites"" vs. ""website"" issue. The lowercase ""i"" is an error in both, but perhaps that's a separate issue not affecting the main question. 

Also, looking at the structure: ""for the magazines, i would include issn numbers."" The comma after ""magazines"" might be a bit awkward. Maybe a semicolon or a period would be better to separate the two independent clauses. But again, both sentences have that structure, so it's not a differentiator between A and B. 

So the key point is the agreement between ""citations"" (plural) and the example given. ""Websites"" is plural, so Sentence A is correct. Sentence B uses ""website,"" which is singular, making it ungrammatical. 

Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the number disagreement. The other issues (lowercase ""i"" and punctuation) are present in both but don't affect the choice between A and B as per the user's question.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Key Reasons:  
1. **Plural Agreement**:  
   - In Sentence A, **""websites""** (plural) correctly matches the plural noun **""citations""**.  
   - In Sentence B, **""website""** (singular) incorrectly refers to the plural **""citations""**, creating a mismatch.  

2. **Use of ""namely""**:  
   - The phrase **""namely""** introduces specific examples that must agree in number with the noun they clarify. Since ""citations"" is plural, the examples (e.g., ""websites"") must also be plural.  

### Additional Notes (Errors in Both Sentences):  
- **Capitalization**: The pronoun **""i""** should be capitalized as **""I""** in both sentences.  
- **Punctuation**: A semicolon or period before **""and for the magazines...""** would improve clarity, as both clauses are independent.  

However, the critical grammatical distinction lies in the **plural agreement** between ""citations"" and ""websites"" (Sentence A) vs. ""website"" (Sentence B)."
7,websites,website,1,"A lot of the citations, namely websites, lack access dates and for the magazines, i would include issn numbers.","A lot of the citations, namely website, lack access dates and for the magazines, i would include issn numbers.",19,4141,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about citations, websites, magazines, and ISSN numbers. 

First, I need to look at both sentences carefully. The main difference between them is the word ""website"" in Sentence A versus ""websites"" in Sentence B. The structure is similar otherwise. 

Starting with Sentence A: ""A lot of the citations, namely website, lack access dates and for the magazines, i would include issn numbers."" The part after ""namely"" is ""website,"" which is singular. But the subject before that is ""a lot of the citations,"" which is plural. So ""citations"" are plural, but the example given is singular. That seems off. If you're giving examples of citations, which are plural, the examples should also be plural. So ""website"" should be ""websites"" to match the plural ""citations.""

Looking at Sentence B: ""A lot of the citations, namely websites, lack access dates and for the magazines, i would include issn numbers."" Here, ""websites"" is plural, which matches ""citations."" That makes sense. So the noun following ""namely"" should agree in number with the noun it's explaining. 

Another thing to check is the use of commas. Both sentences use commas after ""citations"" and around ""namely,"" which is correct because ""namely"" introduces an appositive that provides specific examples. 

Also, in Sentence A, ""i"" is lowercase. In English, the pronoun ""I"" should always be capitalized. Both sentences have this issue, but since the user is focusing on the ""namely"" part, maybe that's a secondary error. However, it's still a grammatical mistake. 

The phrase ""for the magazines"" is followed by a comma, which might be a comma splice if the sentence structure is incorrect. However, the conjunction ""and"" is used to connect the two independent clauses, so the comma before ""and"" is actually correct. Wait, let me check that. The structure is ""A lot of the citations... lack access dates and for the magazines, I would include..."" So after ""and,"" the second clause is ""for the magazines, I would include ISSN numbers."" The comma after ""magazines"" is correct because it's separating the introductory phrase ""for the magazines"" from the main clause ""I would include..."" So that part is okay. 

But in both sentences, ""issn"" is lowercase. ISSN should be all caps since it's an acronym. That's another error, but again, maybe the user is focusing on the ""namely"" part. 

So the key difference is the singular vs. plural after ""namely."" Since ""citations"" are plural, the examples should be plural. Therefore, Sentence B is correct in using ""websites,"" while Sentence A is incorrect with ""website.""

Additionally, the lowercase ""i"" in both sentences is a mistake. Proper nouns and the pronoun ""I"" should be capitalized. Also, ""issn"" should be ""ISSN."" But the primary issue the question is pointing out is the agreement between ""citations"" and the example given. 

So, to sum up, Sentence B is grammatical because it uses the plural ""websites"" to match ""citations,"" while Sentence A is ungrammatical due to the singular ""website"" not agreeing in number.
</think>

**Analysis of the Sentences:**

1. **Sentence A**:  
   *""A lot of the citations, namely website, lack access dates and for the magazines, i would include issn numbers.""*  
   - **Issue**: The word **""website""** (singular) does not agree in number with **""citations""** (plural). The phrase ""namely"" introduces specific examples, so the noun should be plural to match the plural subject.  
   - **Additional Errors**:  
     - **""i""** is lowercase (should be **""I""**).  
     - **""issn""** should be capitalized as **""ISSN""** (an acronym).  

2. **Sentence B**:  
   *""A lot of the citations, namely websites, lack access dates and for the magazines, i would include issn numbers.""*  
   - **Correction**: **""websites""** (plural) matches **""citations""**, resolving the agreement error.  
   - **Remaining Issues**:  
     - **""i""** is still lowercase.  
     - **""issn""** remains uncapitalized.  

**Conclusion**:  
- **Grammatical Sentence**: **Sentence B** (due to correct plural agreement: *citations → websites*).  
- **Ungrammatical Sentence**: **Sentence A** (singular/plural mismatch: *citations → website*).  

**Note**: Both sentences have minor errors (lowercase ""i"" and ""issn""), but the primary grammatical distinction lies in the singular/plural agreement after ""namely."""

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are similar, but there's a difference in the verb used: ""refer"" in Sentence A and ""refers"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to identify the subject of the verb. The main clause in both sentences is ""People... refer(s) to themselves..."" The subject here is ""People,"" which is plural. So the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Refer"" is the plural form, and ""refers"" is singular. That makes me think Sentence A is correct because ""people"" requires a plural verb.

But wait, let me check the structure again. The sentence has a relative clause: ""who migrated from that region that I know."" The ""that I know"" part might be confusing. Is ""that I know"" modifying ""region"" or ""people""? If it's modifying ""region,"" then the structure is ""People [who migrated from that region (that I know)] refer to themselves..."" So the relative clauses are correctly placed, and the main verb is still ""refer"" for ""People."" 

In Sentence B, ""refers"" is singular, which would require a singular subject. But ""People"" is plural, so that's a subject-verb agreement error. Therefore, Sentence B is incorrect. 

Another thing to check: sometimes, intervening phrases can trick us into mismatching subject and verb. But in this case, the relative clauses don't change the subject's number. The core is ""People refer..."" So yes, Sentence A is correct, B is not. 

Also, looking at the rest of the sentence: ""as croatian or of croatian descent."" The lowercase ""croatian"" should probably be capitalized as ""Croatian,"" but the user is asking about grammaticality, not capitalization. So that's a separate issue but not part of the main question here. 

So conclusion: Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is ungrammatical due to subject-verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Explanation:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - The subject of the main clause is **""People""** (plural). The verb must agree with this plural subject.  
   - **Sentence A** uses **""refer""** (plural verb), which correctly matches **""People.""**  
   - **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""refers""** (singular verb), creating a mismatch with the plural subject.  

2. **Structure of Relative Clauses**:  
   - The phrase **""who migrated from that region that I know""** is a complex relative clause modifying **""People.""** It does not affect the subject-verb agreement in the main clause.  
   - The error in Sentence B arises solely from the singular verb **""refers""** conflicting with the plural subject **""People.""**  

### Note:  
- Capitalization of **""Croatian""** is recommended but not strictly a grammatical error here.  
- The phrase **""of Croatian descent""** is idiomatically correct.  

**Conclusion**: Sentence A is correct; Sentence B violates subject-verb agreement."
9,refer,refers,1,People who migrated from that region that i know refer to themselves as croatian or of croatian descent.,People who migrated from that region that i know refers to themselves as croatian or of croatian descent.,18,4200,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are about people from a region referring to themselves as Croatian or of Croatian descent. 

First, I need to look at both sentences carefully. Let's start with Sentence A: ""People who migrated from that region that i know refers to themselves as croatian or of croatian descent.""

Hmm, the structure here is a bit complex. The main subject is ""People,"" followed by a relative clause ""who migrated from that region."" Then there's another relative clause ""that i know."" Wait, ""that I know"" is modifying what? It could be modifying ""region"" or ""people."" But if it's modifying ""region,"" that might not make sense because ""I know"" would refer to the region, but then the verb ""refers"" is singular. The region that I know refers... but the main subject is ""People,"" so the verb should agree with ""People,"" which is plural. But in Sentence A, the verb is ""refers,"" which is singular. That seems like a problem. The main verb should be ""refer"" instead of ""refers"" because ""People"" is plural. 

Now, looking at Sentence B: ""People who migrated from that region that i know refer to themselves as croatian or of croatian descent.""

Here, the verb is ""refer,"" which is plural, matching the subject ""People."" That seems correct. But wait, the placement of ""that I know"" might still be an issue. Let me parse the sentence structure again. The main clause is ""People... refer to themselves..."" The relative clauses are ""who migrated from that region"" and ""that I know."" The problem here is whether ""that I know"" is correctly placed. If ""that I know"" is intended to modify ""people,"" then it should be ""whom I know"" instead of ""that I know,"" but ""that"" can be used for people in restrictive clauses. However, the placement might cause confusion. 

Wait, in Sentence B, the structure is ""People [who migrated from that region] [that I know] refer..."" So the relative clauses are stacked. The first relative clause ""who migrated..."" modifies ""People,"" and the second ""that I know"" also modifies ""People."" So it's saying ""People (who migrated from that region) (that I know) refer..."" So the people are both those who migrated and whom the speaker knows. That makes sense. The verb ""refer"" is plural, so that's correct. 

In Sentence A, the verb ""refers"" is singular, which doesn't agree with the plural subject ""People."" So Sentence A is ungrammatical because of subject-verb agreement. Sentence B fixes that by using ""refer."" However, there might be another issue with the placement of ""that I know."" If ""that I know"" is meant to modify ""region,"" then it would be incorrect because ""that I know"" would then be describing the region, making the sentence structure confusing. But in Sentence B, since ""that I know"" comes after ""region,"" it could be ambiguous. However, in English, relative clauses usually attach to the nearest noun, so ""that I know"" would modify ""region,"" implying the region that the speaker knows. But the intended meaning might be that the people are the ones the speaker knows. So maybe there's a misplaced modifier here. 

But the user is asking about grammaticality, not clarity. Even if the modifier is misplaced, if the syntax is correct, it's grammatical. The main issue is subject-verb agreement. So Sentence A has ""refers"" which is wrong, and Sentence B has ""refer"" which is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and A is not. Also, note that ""i"" should be capitalized as ""I,"" but maybe the user didn't do that, but both sentences have lowercase ""i,"" so that's a separate issue. But assuming that's a typo and not part of the grammar question, the key difference is ""refers"" vs. ""refer.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Key Reasons:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - In **Sentence A**, the verb ""refers"" (singular) incorrectly agrees with the plural subject ""People.""  
   - In **Sentence B**, the verb ""refer"" (plural) correctly matches the plural subject ""People.""  

2. **Relative Clause Ambiguity**:  
   - Both sentences have a slightly awkward structure due to stacked relative clauses (""who migrated from that region that I know""). However, this does not make them ungrammatical. The primary issue in Sentence A is the verb form.  

3. **Minor Issues**:  
   - Both sentences use lowercase ""i"" (should be ""I"") and ""croatian"" (should be capitalized as ""Croatian""). These are orthographic errors but do not affect grammaticality.  

### Conclusion:  
Sentence B is correct because it maintains subject-verb agreement. Sentence A fails due to the singular verb ""refers"" paired with a plural subject."
7,reads,read,1,"A plaque in one of the chapels reads, in three languages, ""what you are now, we once were; what we are now, you shall be.","A plaque in one of the chapels read, in three languages, ""what you are now, we once were; what we are now, you shall be.",25,4348,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are almost identical except for the verb ""reads"" in Sentence A and ""read"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to recall subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""A plaque,"" which is singular. The verb should agree with a singular subject. ""Reads"" is the third person singular present tense form, while ""read"" is either past tense or the base form (which would be used with plural subjects). 

Looking at the context, the sentence is describing a current state—a plaque that is present and has text on it. So the present tense makes sense here. If it were past tense, ""read"" would be correct, but that would imply the plaque no longer exists or no longer has that text, which isn't indicated here.

Another thing to check is the punctuation. Both sentences have the quote starting with a lowercase ""what."" Normally, quotes that are complete sentences should start with a capital letter. However, if the quote is integrated into the sentence, it might not. But in this case, the quote is a complete sentence, so maybe both sentences have a punctuation issue. However, the user is focusing on the verb tense, so that's the main point.

So, Sentence A uses ""reads"" (correct for singular present), and Sentence B uses ""read"" (incorrect unless it's past tense, which doesn't fit the context). Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and B is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject ""a plaque"" is singular, so the verb must agree with it in the present tense. ""Reads"" (Sentence A) is correct for third-person singular, while ""read"" (Sentence B) would only be correct for plural subjects (e.g., ""plaques"") or past tense (which doesn’t fit here, as the plaque’s message is a timeless fact).  

**Note:**  
Both sentences have a punctuation quirk: the quoted text (""what you are now..."") should ideally begin with a capital letter since it’s a full sentence. However, this is a stylistic choice and not strictly ungrammatical. The key error in Sentence B is the verb tense."
7,reads,read,1,"A plaque in one of the chapels reads, in three languages, ""what you are now, we once were; what we are now, you shall be.","A plaque in one of the chapels read, in three languages, ""what you are now, we once were; what we are now, you shall be.",25,4348,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are almost identical except for the verb ""read"" in Sentence A and ""reads"" in Sentence B. The main difference is the tense of the verb.

First, I need to recall subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""a plaque,"" which is singular. In present tense, singular subjects take verbs with an 's' ending. So ""reads"" would be correct for present tense. However, Sentence A uses ""read,"" which is the past tense form. 

But wait, the rest of the sentence might give clues about the tense. Let me check the context. The plaque has an inscription, which is a statement that exists in the present. If the plaque is still there and the inscription is currently readable, then using present tense ""reads"" makes sense. However, if the situation is describing a past event or the plaque is no longer there, past tense ""read"" would be appropriate. 

Looking at the sentences, both use ""read"" and ""reads"" followed by the quoted text. The quoted text itself uses present tense (""you are,"" ""we are"") and future (""you shall be""), which doesn't necessarily indicate the tense of the main verb. 

So the key is whether the action of the plaque ""reading"" something is in the past or present. If the sentence is part of a narrative set in the past, like a story, then ""read"" (past tense) would be correct. If it's a general statement about the plaque's current state, ""reads"" (present tense) is correct. 

But the sentences don't provide context about the timeframe. However, in academic or descriptive writing, when referring to the content of a text that exists now, the present tense is typically used. For example, ""The sign says..."" rather than ""The sign said..."" unless it's no longer there. 

Therefore, Sentence B with ""reads"" is likely the grammatical one because it uses present tense to describe the current inscription on the plaque. Sentence A uses past tense ""read,"" which might be incorrect unless the context specifically requires past tense. Since the sentences don't specify a past context, the default would be present tense. 

Wait, but sometimes in narratives, even if the plaque still exists, past tense is used because the story is told in the past. For example, ""The plaque read..."" in a novel. So both could be correct depending on context. However, the question is about grammaticality without context. In that case, both are grammatically correct but depend on tense. But the user is asking which is ungrammatical. Since both verbs are correctly conjugated, maybe the issue is something else. 

Wait, looking again, the sentences have a quotation. The punctuation: in Sentence A, after ""read, in three languages,"" the quote starts with a lowercase ""what."" But in Sentence B, it's the same. Wait, the user included the quotes as part of the sentence. The original quote should start with a capital letter because it's a complete sentence. So both sentences have the quote starting with lowercase ""what,"" which is incorrect. But the user might be focusing on the verb tense instead. 

Wait, the user's question is about which sentence is grammatical. If the main issue is the verb tense, then both could be correct depending on context. But if the user is considering the punctuation of the quote, then both have an error. However, the user's examples show the quotes with lowercase ""what,"" which is incorrect. But maybe the user made a typo and the actual sentences have correct capitalization. 

Assuming that the user's examples have correct punctuation (maybe the quotes are meant to be in lowercase for some reason, but that's unlikely), the main issue is the verb tense. So if the sentence is in present tense, ""reads"" is correct. If in past tense, ""read"" is correct. Without context, both are grammatically correct. But perhaps the user is testing subject-verb agreement. Since ""a plaque"" is singular, ""reads"" is present tense, ""read"" is past tense. So both are correct in their respective tenses. 

But the user is asking which is ungrammatical. Maybe there's another error. Let me check again. The sentences end with a period inside the quotes. In American English, the period goes inside the quotation marks. So that's correct. The verbs are ""read"" vs. ""reads."" If the sentence is in present tense, ""reads"" is correct. If in past, ""read."" So unless there's a context forcing one tense, both are correct. But the user might be considering that the plaque's inscription is a general truth, so present tense is more appropriate. Therefore, Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect if the plaque still exists. But without context, it's hard to say. However, in standard usage, when describing the content of a text that exists (like a plaque), the present tense is used. So Sentence B is grammatical, Sentence A is ungrammatical. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because the verb should agree with the singular subject ""a plaque"" in present tense as the inscription is a current statement.
</think>

Both sentences are nearly identical, differing only in the verb tense (""read"" vs. ""reads""). Here's the breakdown:

**Sentence A** uses **""read""** (past tense).  
**Sentence B** uses **""reads""** (present tense).  

### Key Analysis:
- The subject **""a plaque""** is singular.  
- In English, when describing the **current content** of a text (e.g., a plaque, book, or sign), the **present tense** is typically used, even if the text is old. This is called the **""timeless present""** convention.  
- Example: *""The sign says...""* (not *""The sign said...""*) unless the text no longer exists or the context explicitly requires past tense.  

### Conclusion:
- **Sentence B** (""reads"") is **grammatical** because it follows the standard rule of using the present tense for existing inscriptions.  
- **Sentence A** (""read"") is **ungrammatical** in most contexts, as it incorrectly uses the past tense to describe the plaque's enduring message.  

**Exception:** If the plaque no longer exists or the narrative is set in the past (e.g., historical fiction), Sentence A could be acceptable. However, without such context, Sentence B is correct."
6,has,have,1,The main section of the woods has a network of public footpaths to facilitate access.,The main section of the woods have a network of public footpaths to facilitate access.,15,4553,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. The difference between them is the verb: ""has"" in A and ""have"" in B. The subject in both is ""The main section of the woods."" 

First, I need to identify the subject of the sentence. The subject here is ""The main section,"" which is singular because ""section"" is a singular noun. The prepositional phrase ""of the woods"" modifies ""section,"" but it doesn't change the number of the subject. So the verb should agree with ""section,"" which is singular.

Sentence A uses ""has,"" which is the third person singular form of the verb ""to have."" That matches the singular subject ""section."" Sentence B uses ""have,"" which is plural. Since the subject is singular, ""have"" would be incorrect. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with collective nouns or when the object is plural. For example, ""a network of footpaths"" is plural, but the verb still agrees with the subject, not the object. So even though there are multiple footpaths, the main section (singular) has them. So the verb should be ""has.""

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. Remove the prepositional phrases: ""The main section has..."" vs. ""The main section have..."" Clearly, ""has"" is correct here. So Sentence A is grammatical, and B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""The main section of the woods""*, which is singular (*section* is the head noun). The verb must agree with the singular subject, so **""has""** (singular) is correct.  

Sentence B incorrectly uses **""have""** (plural), which clashes with the singular subject. Even though *""the woods""* is plural, it is part of a prepositional phrase modifying *""section""* and does not affect subject-verb agreement.  

**Key Tip:**  
Focus on the **head noun** of the subject (*section* here) to determine verb agreement, not the noun in a prepositional phrase (*woods*)."
6,has,have,1,The main section of the woods has a network of public footpaths to facilitate access.,The main section of the woods have a network of public footpaths to facilitate access.,15,4553,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are about the main section of the woods having a network of footpaths.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, the key here is to identify the subject in each sentence and determine if it's singular or plural.

Looking at Sentence A: ""The main section of the woods have a network..."" The subject here is ""the main section."" The phrase ""of the woods"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""section."" Since ""section"" is singular, the verb should agree with it. ""Have"" is plural, so that might be incorrect. But wait, sometimes people get confused with collective nouns or when the prepositional phrase includes a plural noun. However, in this case, the main subject is ""section,"" which is singular. So the verb should be ""has"" instead of ""have."" Therefore, Sentence A is probably incorrect.

Sentence B: ""The main section of the woods has a network..."" Here, the verb is ""has,"" which is singular. That matches the singular subject ""section."" So Sentence B should be correct.

But wait, let me double-check. Sometimes, when the subject is followed by a prepositional phrase with a plural noun, like ""of the woods,"" which is plural, people might mistakenly use a plural verb. But the rule is that the verb agrees with the subject, not the object of the preposition. So ""section"" is singular, so ""has"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because it uses ""have"" with a singular subject.

Another way to test this is to remove the prepositional phrase: ""The main section have..."" vs. ""The main section has..."" Clearly, ""has"" is correct here. So yes, Sentence B is correct.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of both sentences is *""The main section""* (singular). The verb must agree with the singular subject, so **""has""** (singular) is correct.  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses **""have""** (plural), which clashes with the singular subject *""section""*.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses **""has""** (singular), matching the subject.  

The phrase *""of the woods""* is a prepositional phrase modifying the subject but does not affect subject-verb agreement. Always focus on the core subject (*section*) when determining verb form."
7,goes,go,1,"However, the idea of leading verbs goes beyond modals to include ""attitudinal"" verbs such as finje (pretend) and pare (seem).","However, the idea of leading verbs go beyond modals to include ""attitudinal"" verbs such as finje (pretend) and pare (seem).",20,4800,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. Both sentences are very similar except for the verb following ""the idea of leading verbs."" In Sentence A, it's ""goes,"" and in Sentence B, it's ""go."" 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the verb. The main clause here is ""the idea of leading verbs goes/go beyond modals..."" The subject is ""the idea,"" right? Because ""of leading verbs"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""idea."" So the subject is singular (""idea""), so the verb should agree with that.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused when there's a prepositional phrase after the subject. Like, they might think the verb should agree with ""verbs"" instead of ""idea."" But no, the rule is that the verb agrees with the subject, not the object of the preposition. So ""the idea"" is singular, so the verb should be ""goes."" That makes Sentence A correct and Sentence B incorrect because ""go"" is plural.

Let me double-check. If I rephrase the sentence: ""The idea goes beyond modals..."" Yes, that sounds right. If it were ""The ideas go beyond modals..."" then ""go"" would be correct. So in the original sentences, since the subject is ""idea,"" which is singular, ""goes"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because it uses ""go"" instead of ""goes.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb ""goes/go"" is **""the idea""** (singular), not ""leading verbs"" (plural). The prepositional phrase **""of leading verbs""** modifies the subject but does not affect grammatical agreement. Since ""the idea"" is singular, the verb must agree with it, requiring the singular form **""goes""** (Sentence A).  

Sentence B incorrectly uses **""go""** (plural), which clashes with the singular subject ""idea."" This mismatch in subject-verb agreement makes Sentence B ungrammatical.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Always identify the **true subject** of the sentence (ignoring modifying phrases) to ensure proper verb agreement."
7,goes,go,1,"However, the idea of leading verbs goes beyond modals to include ""attitudinal"" verbs such as finje (pretend) and pare (seem).","However, the idea of leading verbs go beyond modals to include ""attitudinal"" verbs such as finje (pretend) and pare (seem).",20,4800,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are about the concept of leading verbs extending beyond modals to include certain attitudinal verbs. 

First, I need to figure out the subject of each sentence. The main clause in both sentences starts with ""the idea of leading verbs..."" The key here is determining whether the subject is singular or plural because that affects the verb agreement. 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""go,"" which is plural. In Sentence B, the verb is ""goes,"" which is singular. So the question is: is the subject singular or plural?

The subject here is ""the idea,"" which is singular. Even though ""leading verbs"" follows, that's part of a prepositional phrase (""of leading verbs"") modifying ""the idea."" The core of the subject is still the singular noun ""idea."" Therefore, the verb should agree with ""idea,"" not ""verbs."" 

So, Sentence B uses ""goes,"" which is correct because it's singular. Sentence A uses ""go,"" which is plural and doesn't agree with the singular subject ""idea."" 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused when there's a prepositional phrase after the subject. For example, in a sentence like ""The group of students is large,"" ""group"" is singular, so the verb is ""is."" Similarly, here, ""the idea"" is singular, so the verb should be ""goes."" 

Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""the idea""* (singular), not *""leading verbs""* (plural). The verb must agree with the singular subject *""idea,""* so the correct form is **""goes""** (singular) in Sentence B. Sentence A incorrectly uses **""go""** (plural), creating a subject-verb agreement error.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
Prepositional phrases like *""of leading verbs""* do not affect subject-verb agreement. The verb must always match the grammatical number of the main subject (*""idea""* in this case)."
5,is,are,1,"The perceptual space between categories is therefore warped, the centers of categories (or ""prototypes"") working like a sieve for incoming speech sounds.","The perceptual space between categories are therefore warped, the centers of categories (or ""prototypes"") working like a sieve for incoming speech sounds.",22,5075,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about the perceptual space between categories being warped, with the centers acting like a sieve.

First, I need to look at the subject-verb agreement. The main clause in both sentences starts with ""The perceptual space between categories..."" In sentence A, the verb is ""is warped,"" while in sentence B, it's ""are warped."" The subject here is ""space,"" which is singular. ""Space"" is a singular noun, so the verb should agree with that. Therefore, ""is"" would be correct, making sentence A correct. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is plural, so that's incorrect. 

Next, I should check the rest of the sentence structure. Both sentences have a participle phrase after the comma: ""the centers...working like a sieve."" That part seems okay in both cases because participle phrases can be used to add information without a conjunction. So the issue isn't there. The main problem is the verb agreement in the main clause.

Wait, maybe someone could confuse ""categories"" as the subject? Let me think. The subject is ""space,"" not ""categories."" The phrase ""between categories"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""space."" So the verb should definitely agree with ""space,"" which is singular. So yes, sentence A is correct, B is wrong.

I should also consider if there's any other grammatical issue, but the user specifically pointed out the two sentences with the difference in ""is"" vs. ""are."" So the key here is subject-verb agreement. Confirming that ""space"" is singular, so ""is"" is correct. Therefore, sentence A is grammatical, and B is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the first clause is *""The perceptual space between categories""*, where the core noun is *""space""* (singular). The verb must agree with the singular subject, so *""is""* (singular) is correct. Sentence B incorrectly uses *""are""* (plural), violating subject-verb agreement.  

The rest of the sentence structure (the participle phrase *""the centers... working like a sieve...""*) is grammatically valid in both cases, but the error in verb agreement makes Sentence B ungrammatical."
5,is,are,1,"The perceptual space between categories is therefore warped, the centers of categories (or ""prototypes"") working like a sieve for incoming speech sounds.","The perceptual space between categories are therefore warped, the centers of categories (or ""prototypes"") working like a sieve for incoming speech sounds.",22,5075,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both very similar except for the verb ""are"" vs. ""is"" in the first part.

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The main clause in both sentences starts with ""The perceptual space between categories..."" The verb here is either ""are"" or ""is"". The subject is ""space"", which is singular. ""Between categories"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""space"", so it doesn't affect the verb number. Therefore, the correct verb should be ""is"" to agree with the singular ""space"". That would make Sentence B correct and Sentence A incorrect.

But wait, maybe there's something else. Let me look again. The sentence continues with a participle phrase: ""the centers... working like a sieve"". That part is okay as an absolute phrase, providing additional info. So the main clause is ""The perceptual space... is therefore warped,"" which is correct. Sentence A uses ""are"", which would require a plural subject, but ""space"" is singular. So yes, Sentence B is grammatical, A is not.

I should also check if there's any other grammatical issues. The rest of the sentence structure seems fine. The absolute phrase after the comma is correctly structured. So the only error is the subject-verb agreement in Sentence A. Therefore, the answer is that Sentence B is correct, and A is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the first clause is *""The perceptual space between categories""*, where the core noun (*""space""*) is singular. The verb must agree with this singular subject, so **""is""** (Sentence B) is correct. Sentence A incorrectly uses **""are""**, which would require a plural subject (e.g., *""spaces""*).  

The second part of the sentence (*""the centers... working like a sieve...""*) is grammatically acceptable as an absolute phrase, providing additional description.  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement.  
- ✅ **Sentence B:** *""The perceptual space [...] **is** therefore warped""* (singular subject + singular verb).  
- ❌ **Sentence A:** *""The perceptual space [...] **are** therefore warped""* (singular subject + plural verb)."
6,are,is,1,"Other notable peaks in the range are rosennock (), zirbitzkogel () and großer speikkogel ().","Other notable peaks in the range is rosennock (), zirbitzkogel () and großer speikkogel ().",15,5650,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both listing some peaks. The main difference between them is the verb: Sentence A uses ""are"" while Sentence B uses ""is"". 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. Here, the subject in both sentences is ""Other notable peaks in the range"". Let's break that down.

The word ""peaks"" is plural, so the subject is plural. The verb that follows should agree with that. In Sentence A, the verb is ""are"", which is the plural form of ""to be"". In Sentence B, it's ""is"", which is singular. So right away, that makes me think Sentence B is incorrect because a plural subject needs a plural verb. 

But wait, maybe there's something else here. Let me check the structure again. The sentence structure is: [Subject] [verb] [list of items]. The subject is definitely ""Other notable peaks"", which is plural. The verb should be ""are"" to match. The list that follows are the names of the peaks, which are all plural items, but the verb isn't agreeing with the list; it's agreeing with the subject. 

Another thing to consider is if there's a compound subject. But in this case, the peaks are the subject, and the list after the verb is the predicate nominative. So the verb ""are"" is correct because the subject is plural. If the sentence started with ""The notable peak..."", then ""is"" would be correct. But here, it's ""peaks"", so ""are"" is needed. 

So Sentence A uses ""are"" correctly, and Sentence B incorrectly uses ""is"" with a plural subject. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical. 

I should also check if there's any exception or special case I'm missing. For example, sometimes when the subject is a collective noun, like ""group"", the verb can be singular. But ""peaks"" isn't a collective noun; it's a straightforward plural. So no exceptions here. 

Another point: sometimes in lists, people might confuse the verb with the items listed, but the verb should agree with the subject, not the predicate. So even though there are multiple items listed after the verb, the verb still needs to agree with the subject ""peaks"". 

Yep, that's right. So the conclusion is Sentence A is correct, Sentence B is wrong because of subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Other notable peaks in the range""** (plural), so the verb must agree with a plural subject.  
- Sentence A correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb).  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), which does not match the plural subject.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
Subject-verb agreement requires that plural subjects pair with plural verbs (e.g., ""are""), and singular subjects pair with singular verbs (e.g., ""is"")."
6,are,is,1,"Other notable peaks in the range are rosennock (), zirbitzkogel () and großer speikkogel ().","Other notable peaks in the range is rosennock (), zirbitzkogel () and großer speikkogel ().",15,5650,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both listing some peaks. The main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""Other notable peaks in the range."" The word ""peaks"" is plural, so the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Are"" is the plural form of the verb ""to be,"" while ""is"" is singular. So, ""peaks are"" would be correct. 

Wait, but let me double-check. The structure is ""Other notable peaks... is/are..."" Since ""peaks"" is the subject, and it's plural, the verb should definitely be ""are."" Sentence B uses ""are,"" so that should be correct. Sentence A uses ""is,"" which doesn't match the plural subject. 

But maybe there's a trick here. Sometimes, when there's a list following the verb, people might get confused. However, in this case, the subject is still ""peaks,"" which is plural, regardless of the list that comes after. The verb should agree with the subject, not the items in the list. So even though the list has multiple items, the verb is determined by the subject ""peaks.""

Another thing to check: sometimes with ""there is/are"" constructions, the verb can be influenced by the first item in the list, but this isn't one of those cases. The sentence starts with ""Other notable peaks... are..."" so the subject is clear. 

So, Sentence B is correct because ""are"" matches the plural subject. Sentence A is incorrect because ""is"" is singular. The user might be confused if they think the list affects the verb, but the key is the subject before the verb. 

I should also note that the parentheses with empty spaces might be placeholders for something else, like elevation or other info, but that doesn't affect the grammar here. The main issue is subject-verb agreement. 

Therefore, the answer is that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Other notable peaks""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number. The plural verb **""are""** (Sentence B) correctly matches the plural subject. Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb **""is""**, which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
- **Plural subjects** require **plural verbs** (e.g., *peaks are*).  
- **Singular subjects** require **singular verbs** (e.g., *peak is*).  

Thus, **""peaks are""** (Sentence B) is correct."
6,are,is,1,"Major shopping malls along the road are the guihe shopping center (), the sofitel silver plaza, and the wanda shopping mall ().","Major shopping malls along the road is the guihe shopping center (), the sofitel silver plaza, and the wanda shopping mall ().",22,5723,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about major shopping malls along a road, listing three examples. 

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used: Sentence A uses ""are"" while Sentence B uses ""is"". The subject here is ""Major shopping malls along the road"", which is a plural noun phrase because ""malls"" is plural. 

In English, the verb must agree with the subject in number. Plural subjects take plural verbs, and singular subjects take singular verbs. So, ""Major shopping malls"" is plural, so the verb should be ""are"". That would make Sentence A correct.

Sentence B uses ""is"", which is singular. That doesn't agree with the plural subject, so Sentence B is incorrect. 

Wait, but sometimes there can be tricky cases where the subject might seem plural but is actually singular. For example, if the sentence started with ""The list of major shopping malls..."", then ""list"" is singular and would take ""is"". But in this case, the subject is clearly ""Major shopping malls"", which is plural. 

Another thing to check is if there's a predicate nominative that might confuse the subject-verb agreement. The structure here is ""X are Y"", where X is the subject and Y is the predicate. Even if Y is a list of items, the verb still agrees with X. Since X is plural, ""are"" is correct. 

So, confirming again: Sentence A uses ""are"" correctly with the plural subject. Sentence B incorrectly uses ""is"". Therefore, A is grammatical, B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Major shopping malls along the road""**, which is plural. The verb must agree with the subject in number.  
- Sentence A correctly uses the plural verb **""are""** to match the plural subject.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses the singular verb **""is""**, which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Note:** Proper nouns like ""Guihe Shopping Center"" and ""Wanda Shopping Mall"" should also be capitalized for full correctness."
6,are,is,1,"Major shopping malls along the road are the guihe shopping center (), the sofitel silver plaza, and the wanda shopping mall ().","Major shopping malls along the road is the guihe shopping center (), the sofitel silver plaza, and the wanda shopping mall ().",22,5723,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are similar except for the verb: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B. The subject here is ""Major shopping malls along the road,"" and the predicate nominative lists three places.

First, I need to determine the subject-verb agreement. The subject is ""Major shopping malls,"" which is plural. The verb should agree with the subject in number. ""Are"" is the plural form of the verb ""to be,"" while ""is"" is singular. So, ""are"" would be correct here. That would make Sentence B correct and Sentence A incorrect.

Wait, but sometimes when the sentence is structured with a list following the verb, the verb might agree with the subject before it. Let me think. The structure here is ""X is/are Y."" In this case, X is the subject. So if X is plural, the verb should be plural. ""Major shopping malls"" is definitely plural, so ""are"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is not because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject.

Another way to check is to reverse the sentence. If we say, ""The guihe shopping center, the sofitel silver plaza, and the wanda shopping mall are the major shopping malls along the road,"" the verb ""are"" still matches the plural subject. So that confirms that ""are"" is the right choice. Sentence B is correct.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""Major shopping malls along the road,"" which is plural. The verb must agree with the plural subject, so ""are"" (plural) is correct in Sentence B. Sentence A incorrectly uses ""is"" (singular), violating subject-verb agreement.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
- Plural subjects require plural verbs (e.g., ""malls **are**"").  
- Singular subjects require singular verbs (e.g., ""mall **is**"").

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both starting the same way but differing in the verb used in the second clause: ""reflect"" vs. ""reflects"". 

First, I need to identify the subject of the verb in question. The second clause in both sentences is ""the towns built at the mine head reflect/reflects its productivity."" The subject here is ""the towns"", which is plural because ""towns"" ends with an 's'. The verb needs to agree with the subject in number. 

In sentence A, the verb is ""reflect"", which is plural. That matches the plural subject ""towns"", so that should be correct. In sentence B, the verb is ""reflects"", which is singular. Since the subject is plural, ""reflects"" would be incorrect. 

Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. Let me double-check. The phrase ""built at the mine head"" is a participial phrase modifying ""towns"", so the main subject is still ""towns"". The verb should definitely agree with ""towns"", so ""reflect"" is correct. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes people get confused with intervening phrases. For example, if the subject was something like ""the town built at the mine head"", then ""reflects"" would be correct. But here it's ""towns"", plural. So sentence B is wrong because it uses the singular verb with a plural subject.

Therefore, sentence A is grammatical, and sentence B is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The key difference lies in subject-verb agreement in the second clause:  
- **Subject**: ""the towns built at the mine head"" (plural, because ""towns"" is plural).  
- **Verb**:  
  - Sentence A uses **""reflect""** (plural verb), which correctly agrees with the plural subject ""towns.""  
  - Sentence B incorrectly uses **""reflects""** (singular verb), creating a mismatch with the plural subject.  

The error in Sentence B violates the rule that a plural subject requires a plural verb. Thus, Sentence A is correct."
21,reflect,reflects,1,"Hecla was the richest of the separate copper mines of the keweenaw, and the towns built at the mine head reflect its productivity.","Hecla was the richest of the separate copper mines of the keweenaw, and the towns built at the mine head reflects its productivity.",23,5874,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about Hecla being a rich copper mine and the towns built there reflecting its productivity.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. Both start the same way: ""Hecla was the richest of the separate copper mines of the keweenaw, and..."" The difference comes in the second part. Sentence A says ""the towns built at the mine head reflects its productivity,"" while Sentence B uses ""reflect"" instead of ""reflects.""

The key here is subject-verb agreement. The subject in the second part is ""the towns,"" which is plural. So the verb needs to agree with a plural subject. ""Reflects"" is singular, and ""reflect"" is plural. Therefore, ""the towns... reflect"" would be correct. So Sentence B should be the grammatical one, and Sentence A is incorrect because it uses the singular verb with a plural subject.

Wait, let me double-check. The subject is ""towns,"" which is definitely plural. The verb should be ""reflect"" without the 's'. So yes, Sentence B is correct. Sentence A has ""reflects,"" which doesn't match the plural subject. That makes sense. Also, ""keweenaw"" should probably be capitalized since it's a place name, but maybe the user is following a specific style or it's a typo. The main issue here is the verb agreement, so focusing on that is key.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the second clause in both sentences is **""the towns""** (plural). The verb must agree in number with the subject.  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses **""reflects""** (singular verb) with the plural subject **""towns.""**  
- Sentence B correctly uses **""reflect""** (plural verb) to match **""towns.""**  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement.  
**Note:** ""Keweenaw"" should also be capitalized as it is a proper noun (a peninsula in Michigan), but this was not the focus of the question."
7,are,is,1,The sound effects achieved with the instrument are similar to the sounds that can be achieved with the 3rd bridge playing technique.,The sound effects achieved with the instrument is similar to the sounds that can be achieved with the 3rd bridge playing technique.,22,5986,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both comparing sound effects from an instrument to the 3rd bridge technique. The main difference between them is the verb: Sentence A uses ""are"" and Sentence B uses ""is"". 

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""The sound effects achieved with the instrument"". ""Sound effects"" is plural, so the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Are"" is plural, and ""is"" is singular. That makes me think Sentence A is correct because ""are"" matches the plural subject.

But wait, maybe there's a trick here. Could the subject be something else? Let me parse the sentence again. The main clause is ""The sound effects... are similar..."". The verb ""achieved"" is a past participle modifying ""sound effects"", so the head noun is still ""effects"", which is plural. So the verb should definitely be ""are"". 

Sentence B uses ""is"", which would require a singular subject. But the subject here is plural, so that's a subject-verb agreement error. Therefore, Sentence B is ungrammatical. 

I should also check if there's any other part of the sentence that might affect this. The rest of the sentence after ""similar to..."" is a prepositional phrase and doesn't influence the subject-verb agreement. So yes, the key issue is the plural subject needing a plural verb. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes collective nouns or phrases can be tricky, but ""sound effects"" is clearly plural. There's no ambiguity here. So the conclusion is that Sentence A is correct, Sentence B is incorrect because of the verb ""is"" not agreeing with the plural subject.
</think>

**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The subject of the sentence is **""The sound effects""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), which clashes with the plural subject.  

The error in Sentence B violates **subject-verb agreement**, a fundamental rule of grammar. The rest of the sentence structure is identical and correct in both examples.  

**Correct:**  
*The sound effects ...* **are** *similar to the sounds ...*  

**Incorrect:**  
*The sound effects ...* **is** *similar to the sounds ...*"
7,are,is,1,The sound effects achieved with the instrument are similar to the sounds that can be achieved with the 3rd bridge playing technique.,The sound effects achieved with the instrument is similar to the sounds that can be achieved with the 3rd bridge playing technique.,22,5986,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both comparing sound effects from an instrument to the 3rd bridge technique. The main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in A and ""are"" in B.

First, I need to check subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""The sound effects achieved with the instrument."" The verb comes after that. ""Sound effects"" is plural, so the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Are"" is plural, and ""is"" is singular. So sentence B uses ""are,"" which matches the plural subject. Sentence A uses ""is,"" which doesn't agree. 

Wait, but maybe someone could think the subject is ""the instrument"" instead? No, the subject here is ""sound effects,"" which is definitely plural. The phrase ""achieved with the instrument"" is a participial phrase modifying the subject, not the subject itself. So the verb needs to agree with ""sound effects."" 

Another thing to check: sometimes people get confused with phrases that come between the subject and verb. In this case, ""achieved with the instrument"" is between ""sound effects"" and the verb. But even with that phrase, the subject is still plural. So ""are"" is correct. 

Therefore, sentence B is grammatical because it uses ""are"" to agree with the plural subject. Sentence A is ungrammatical because it incorrectly uses ""is"" with a plural subject. 

I should also make sure there are no other issues. The rest of the sentences seem okay. Both use ""similar to"" correctly, and the comparison structure looks fine. The only error is the subject-verb agreement in sentence A. 

So the conclusion is that sentence B is correct, and sentence A is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""The sound effects,"" which is plural. The verb must agree in number with the subject.  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb ""**is**"" (""The sound effects ... **is**""), which does not match the plural subject.  
- Sentence B correctly uses the plural verb ""**are**"" (""The sound effects ... **are**""), ensuring subject-verb agreement.  

**Key Issue:**  
Subject-verb agreement. The phrase ""achieved with the instrument"" is a modifier and does not affect the number of the subject. The core subject (""sound effects"") remains plural."
17,are,is,1,"It seems that no fair use case can possibly succeed, if the people in the photo are still alive.","It seems that no fair use case can possibly succeed, if the people in the photo is still alive.",19,6069,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Both are very similar except for the verb in the dependent clause. 

First, I need to look at the structure of each sentence. The main clause is ""It seems that no fair use case can possibly succeed,"" followed by a conditional clause starting with ""if."" The difference is in the verb after ""the people in the photo."" Sentence A uses ""are"" and Sentence B uses ""is.""

Now, the subject of the conditional clause in both sentences is ""the people in the photo."" The word ""people"" is a plural noun. So, the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Are"" is the plural form of the verb ""to be,"" while ""is"" is singular. Therefore, ""people are"" is correct, and ""people is"" is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. Could ""the people in the photo"" be considered a singular noun phrase? For example, sometimes collective nouns like ""team"" or ""group"" can take singular verbs. But ""people"" is already plural. The singular form is ""person."" So ""people"" is plural, so the verb should be ""are.""

Therefore, Sentence A is correct because it uses ""are"" with the plural subject ""people."" Sentence B incorrectly uses ""is,"" which is singular, making it ungrammatical. 

I should also check if there's any other part of the sentences that might be problematic. The main clauses look okay. The conditional structure ""if..."" is correctly placed, though sometimes commas can be tricky. But the user is focusing on grammaticality related to subject-verb agreement here. So the key issue is ""are"" vs. ""is"" with ""people.""

Yes, I think that's the main point. So the answer is that Sentence A is grammatical and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the conditional clause in both sentences is **""the people in the photo""**. The word **""people""** is a plural noun, so it requires a plural verb (**""are""**). Sentence B incorrectly uses the singular verb **""is""**, which does not agree with the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **People** (plural) → **are** (correct in Sentence A).  
- **People** (plural) → **is** (incorrect in Sentence B).  

Sentence B violates **subject-verb agreement**, making it ungrammatical."
17,are,is,1,"It seems that no fair use case can possibly succeed, if the people in the photo are still alive.","It seems that no fair use case can possibly succeed, if the people in the photo is still alive.",19,6069,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are about whether a fair use case can succeed depending on the people in a photo being alive.

First, I need to look at the difference between the two sentences. Both are very similar except for the verb used in the dependent clause. Sentence A uses ""is"" and Sentence B uses ""are."" The subject of that clause is ""the people in the photo."" 

Now, ""people"" is a plural noun. Even though ""people"" can sometimes be tricky because it's irregular (the singular is ""person""), in this case, ""people"" is clearly plural. So the verb should agree with a plural subject. That means ""are"" is correct, and ""is"" would be incorrect. 

Looking at Sentence A: ""if the people in the photo is still alive."" The subject ""people"" is plural, so the verb should be ""are."" Using ""is"" here is a subject-verb agreement error. 

Sentence B uses ""are,"" which matches the plural subject. So Sentence B is correct. 

I should also check if there are any other issues in the sentences. The comma after ""succeed"" in both might be a stylistic choice, but in terms of grammar, the main issue is the subject-verb agreement. 

Another thing to consider is the phrase ""still alive."" Since ""people"" is plural, ""alive"" should refer to multiple individuals, which it does. So that part is okay. 

So the conclusion is that Sentence B is grammatical because it uses ""are"" with the plural subject ""people,"" while Sentence A is ungrammatical due to the incorrect ""is.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the dependent clause (*""the people in the photo""*) is plural, so the verb must agree in number.  
- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses the singular verb *""is""* with the plural subject *""people.""*  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses the plural verb *""are""* to match the plural subject.  

**Corrected Structure:**  
*""If the people in the photo **are** still alive.""*  

**Note:** The comma placement after *""succeed""* is also slightly awkward in both sentences, but the primary grammatical error in Sentence A is the subject-verb agreement."
6,is,are,1,An attempt to address these limitations is the capacitor-commutated converter (ccc) which has been used in a small number of hvdc systems.,An attempt to address these limitations are the capacitor-commutated converter (ccc) which has been used in a small number of hvdc systems.,22,6104,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, and the only difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in A and ""are"" in B. The subject here is ""An attempt to address these limitations,"" and the verb needs to agree with that subject.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs. The subject in both sentences is ""An attempt,"" which is singular because ""an"" is an indefinite article used with singular nouns. The verb in sentence A is ""is,"" which is singular, and in sentence B, it's ""are,"" which is plural. So, at first glance, sentence A should be correct because ""an attempt"" is singular and requires ""is.""

But wait, sometimes sentences can be inverted, where the subject comes after the verb. In such cases, it's easy to get confused. For example, in ""Here comes the bus,"" the subject is ""the bus,"" which is singular, so the verb ""comes"" agrees. Similarly, in ""There are many reasons,"" the subject ""reasons"" is plural, so ""are"" is correct. 

Looking at the sentences here, the structure is ""An attempt... is/are the capacitor-commutated converter..."" So the sentence is structured with the subject complement ""the capacitor-commutated converter"" coming after the verb. The key here is that the verb should agree with the subject, not the complement. The subject is ""An attempt,"" which is singular, so the verb should be ""is,"" making sentence A correct. 

Sentence B uses ""are,"" which would be correct if the subject were plural, like ""Attempts... are..."" But since the subject is singular, ""are"" is incorrect. 

Another way to check is to reverse the sentence structure. If we rephrase it as ""The capacitor-commutated converter (ccc)... is an attempt to address these limitations,"" it's clear that ""is"" is correct. The verb still agrees with ""converter,"" which is singular, but in the original sentence, the subject is ""attempt,"" so the verb must agree with that. 

I might also consider if there's any intervening phrase that could confuse the subject. The phrase ""to address these limitations"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""attempt,"" but it doesn't affect the number of the subject. The core subject remains ""An attempt,"" which is singular. 

Therefore, sentence A is grammatical, and sentence B is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The subject of the sentence is **""An attempt""** (singular), so the verb must agree with it. The correct verb is **""is""** (singular), not **""are""** (plural).  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""is""** to match the singular subject (""An attempt"").  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""are""**, which would only be correct if the subject were plural (e.g., ""Attempts"").  

The confusion might arise because the complement (""the capacitor-commutated converter"") is singular, but the verb must agree with the grammatical subject (**""An attempt""**), not the complement.  

### Key Rule:  
**Subject-verb agreement** requires the verb to match the number (singular/plural) of the grammatical subject, not the complement."
6,is,are,1,An attempt to address these limitations is the capacitor-commutated converter (ccc) which has been used in a small number of hvdc systems.,An attempt to address these limitations are the capacitor-commutated converter (ccc) which has been used in a small number of hvdc systems.,22,6104,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about an attempt and a converter. The main difference between them is the verb: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, the key here is to identify the subject of the sentence and determine if it's singular or plural.

Looking at both sentences, the subject is ""An attempt to address these limitations."" The word ""attempt"" is singular because it's preceded by ""an,"" which is an indefinite article used for singular nouns. So the subject is singular. 

The verb in question is either ""are"" or ""is."" Since the subject is singular, the verb should also be singular. ""Is"" is the singular form of the verb ""to be,"" while ""are"" is plural. Therefore, Sentence B uses the correct singular verb ""is,"" making it grammatical. Sentence A uses ""are,"" which doesn't agree with the singular subject, so it's ungrammatical.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused when there's a prepositional phrase or other modifiers between the subject and the verb. In this case, ""to address these limitations"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""attempt."" The subject is still ""An attempt,"" so the verb should still agree with ""attempt,"" not ""limitations."" Since ""limitations"" is plural, someone might mistakenly use ""are,"" but that's incorrect because the subject is singular. 

Another thing to check: the sentence structure. The structure is ""An attempt... is the capacitor-commutated converter..."" Here, the converter is the thing that is the attempt. So the verb ""is"" links the subject ""attempt"" to the complement ""converter."" Since ""attempt"" is singular, ""is"" is correct. If the subject were plural, like ""Attempts,"" then ""are"" would be correct, but that's not the case here.

So, confirming again: Subject is singular (""An attempt""), verb should be singular (""is""). Therefore, Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect because it uses the plural verb ""are"" with a singular subject.
</think>

The grammatical sentence is **Sentence B**, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""An attempt"" (singular), so the verb must agree in number. The correct singular verb is **""is""** (Sentence B). Sentence A incorrectly uses **""are""** (plural verb), which clashes with the singular subject ""An attempt.""  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
- **Subject-verb agreement:** Singular subjects require singular verbs; plural subjects require plural verbs.  
- Here, ""An attempt"" (singular) → ""is"" (singular verb).  

**Ungrammatical (Sentence A):**  
*An attempt to address these limitations* **are** *the capacitor-commutated converter...*  

**Grammatical (Sentence B):**  
*An attempt to address these limitations* **is** *the capacitor-commutated converter...*"
15,has,have,1,"A game is composed of three such rounds, so the majority of the players has a chance at playing both roles.","A game is composed of three such rounds, so the majority of the players have a chance at playing both roles.",21,6154,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: Sentence A or Sentence B. The key difference between them is the verb used with ""the majority of the players""—""has"" in A and ""have"" in B.

First, I need to remember the subject-verb agreement rules. The main point here is whether ""majority"" is singular or plural. Generally, ""majority"" can be tricky because it depends on what it's referring to. If it's a collective noun acting as a single unit, it takes a singular verb. But if it's referring to the individuals within the group, it takes a plural verb.

In Sentence A, ""the majority of the players has..."" uses ""has,"" which is singular. Sentence B uses ""have,"" which is plural. Now, ""players"" is a plural noun, so ""the majority of the players"" is referring to more than one player. That makes me think that the verb should agree with the plural noun here. So ""the majority of the players have..."" would be correct because the focus is on the individual players having a chance. 

Wait, but sometimes ""majority"" itself is considered singular. For example, ""The majority rules."" But in that case, it's the majority as a single entity. However, when it's ""majority of [plural noun],"" like ""players,"" the verb usually agrees with the plural noun. So ""have"" would be correct here. 

Let me check some examples. If I say, ""The majority of the students are attending,"" that's correct because ""students"" is plural. Similarly, ""The majority of the committee members have voted."" But if it's ""The majority is in favor,"" then it's singular because it's the majority as a single group. 

So applying that here, since ""players"" is plural, the verb should be plural. Therefore, Sentence B is correct. Sentence A is incorrect because it uses the singular ""has"" with a plural subject. 

Another way to think about it: if you remove ""the majority of,"" you get ""the players have,"" which is clearly correct. So even with ""the majority of,"" the verb should still agree with ""players,"" which is plural. 

Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject in question is *""the majority of the players.""* Here, **""majority""** refers to a plural noun (*players*), so the verb must agree with the plural sense of the group. While ""majority"" can sometimes take a singular verb when treated as a single entity (e.g., *""The majority supports the policy""*), in this case, the phrase **""the majority of the players""** emphasizes individual members within the group. Thus, the plural verb **""have""** (Sentence B) is correct.  

Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb **""has""**, which clashes with the plural context.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
When ""majority"" is followed by a plural noun (e.g., *players*), the verb should be plural. If ""majority"" stands alone as a singular concept, use a singular verb."
15,has,have,1,"A game is composed of three such rounds, so the majority of the players has a chance at playing both roles.","A game is composed of three such rounds, so the majority of the players have a chance at playing both roles.",21,6154,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The key difference between them is the verb following ""the majority of the players""—""have"" in Sentence A and ""has"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to recall the rules about subject-verb agreement with collective nouns like ""majority."" The word ""majority"" can be tricky because it can take a singular or plural verb depending on the context. If ""majority"" refers to a single entity as a whole, it's singular. But if it refers to the individuals within the group, it's plural. 

In these sentences, ""the majority of the players"" is the subject. ""Players"" is plural, so the phrase ""majority of the players"" is referring to a group of individuals. In such cases, the verb should agree with the noun that follows ""of,"" which is ""players"" here. Since ""players"" is plural, the verb should be plural as well. That would make ""have"" correct in Sentence A. 

But wait, sometimes ""majority"" alone can be considered singular. For example, ""The majority has decided."" But when it's ""majority of [plural noun],"" the verb usually becomes plural. So in Sentence B, using ""has"" might be incorrect because it's treating ""majority"" as singular even though it's followed by a plural noun. 

Let me check some examples. If I say, ""The majority of students are present,"" that's correct. If I say, ""The majority of students is present,"" that sounds wrong. So the same logic applies here. ""Players"" are plural, so ""have"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is not. 

I should also consider the structure of the sentence. The main clause is ""A game is composed..."" and the second part is the result clause starting with ""so."" The focus is on the players having a chance. Since the players are plural, the verb should agree. 

Another angle: if we remove ""the majority of,"" the sentence would be ""the players have a chance,"" which is correct. Adding ""the majority of"" doesn't change the plurality because it's specifying a part of the plural noun. So the verb remains plural. 

Therefore, Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect because it uses a singular verb with a plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject in question is *""the majority of the players.""* Here, **""majority""** functions as a **collective noun** that refers to multiple individuals (players). When the emphasis is on the **individual members** of the group (as in this case, where players are acting independently by ""playing both roles""), the verb should agree with the **plural noun** (*players*). Thus:  
- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""have""** (plural verb).  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""has""** (singular verb), which clashes with the plural sense of the subject.  

**Key Rule:**  
When a collective noun (e.g., *majority, team, group*) is followed by **""of + plural noun,""** the verb typically agrees with the **plural noun** (e.g., *players*). Use a **plural verb** unless the collective noun explicitly refers to a single unit.  

Example:  
- Correct: *The majority of voters **support** the policy.*  
- Incorrect: *The majority of voters **supports** the policy.*"
7,is,are,1,"The amount of celebrities he has met is also irrelevant, as well as the actual celebrities he met.","The amount of celebrities he has met are also irrelevant, as well as the actual celebrities he met.",18,6426,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about the ""amount of celebrities"" someone has met. The difference is in the verb: Sentence A uses ""is"" and Sentence B uses ""are"". 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""the amount"", which is a singular noun. So the verb should agree with ""amount"", not the object of the preposition ""of celebrities"". That means ""amount"" takes a singular verb. So ""is"" would be correct.

But wait, sometimes people confuse ""amount"" with ""number"". ""Amount"" is used for uncountable nouns, like ""the amount of water"", while ""number"" is for countable, like ""the number of people"". Here, ""celebrities"" are countable, so maybe ""number"" would be better. But the question isn't about that; it's about the verb agreement. Even if ""number"" is more appropriate, the original sentences use ""amount"", so I should focus on that.

So, Sentence A uses ""is"", which is correct because ""amount"" is singular. Sentence B uses ""are"", which is incorrect because it's plural. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and B is not. 

Also, looking at the rest of the sentences: ""as well as the actual celebrities he met."" The structure after ""as well as"" is a parenthetical element, so the verb still agrees with the main subject ""amount"". So that part doesn't affect the verb choice. 

Another thing to check: sometimes ""the amount"" can be followed by a plural noun, but the verb still stays singular. For example, ""The amount of books he has is large."" Even though ""books"" is plural, ""amount"" is singular. So same rule applies here. 

Therefore, the answer should be that Sentence A is correct, and B is incorrect because of subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - The subject of the first clause is *""The amount of celebrities""*.  
   - *""Amount""* is a singular noun (referring to a collective quantity), so the verb must agree with the singular *""amount""*, not the plural *""celebrities""*.  
   - **Correct**: *""The amount ...* ***is*** *irrelevant""* (Sentence A).  
   - **Incorrect**: *""The amount ...* ***are*** *irrelevant""* (Sentence B).  

2. **""Amount"" vs. ""Number""**:  
   - While *""amount""* is technically used for uncountable nouns (e.g., *""the amount of water""*), and *""number""* is preferred for countable nouns like *""celebrities""*, this distinction does not affect the grammaticality of the verb choice here. The focus is on agreement, not semantic precision.  

3. **Parenthetical Phrase**:  
   - The phrase *""as well as the actual celebrities he met""* is parenthetical and does not influence the verb agreement in the main clause.  

**Conclusion**: Sentence A correctly uses the singular verb *""is""* to agree with *""amount""*. Sentence B incorrectly uses *""are""*."
7,is,are,1,"The amount of celebrities he has met is also irrelevant, as well as the actual celebrities he met.","The amount of celebrities he has met are also irrelevant, as well as the actual celebrities he met.",18,6426,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about the ""amount of celebrities"" someone has met and their relevance. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""the amount,"" which is a singular noun. So, the verb should agree with a singular subject. That would mean using ""is"" instead of ""are."" So Sentence B uses ""is,"" which should be correct. But wait, sometimes people confuse ""amount"" with ""number."" ""Amount"" is used for uncountable nouns, like ""the amount of water,"" while ""number"" is for countable nouns, like ""the number of books."" Here, ""celebrities"" are countable, so maybe ""number"" would be better. But the question isn't about that; it's about the verb agreement. Even if ""number"" is more appropriate, the sentences use ""amount,"" so focusing on the verb.

So, ""the amount... is"" vs. ""the amount... are."" Since ""amount"" is singular, ""is"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is not. Also, looking at the rest of the sentence: ""as well as the actual celebrities he met."" The phrase ""as well as"" doesn't change the subject's number, so the verb still agrees with ""the amount."" So even if there's another noun after ""as well as,"" the verb should still be singular. That confirms that Sentence B is correct. Sentence A uses ""are,"" which is plural, so it's incorrect. 

Another thing to check: sometimes people might think the subject is ""celebrities,"" but no, the subject is ""the amount."" The prepositional phrase ""of celebrities"" modifies ""amount,"" but the head noun is ""amount."" So the verb must agree with ""amount,"" not ""celebrities."" Therefore, ""is"" is correct. 

So the conclusion is Sentence B is grammatical, Sentence A is ungrammatical. Also, maybe note that ""number"" would be better than ""amount"" here, but that's not part of the current question. The user is specifically asking about the verb agreement. So the answer is Sentence B is correct, Sentence A is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the first clause is *""The amount of celebrities""*. The word **""amount""** is singular, so the verb must agree with it.  
  - ✅ **Sentence B** correctly uses **""is""** (singular verb).  
  - ❌ **Sentence A** incorrectly uses **""are""** (plural verb), which clashes with the singular subject ""amount.""  

**Additional Notes:**  
1. **""Amount"" vs. ""Number"":** While ""amount"" is technically used for uncountable nouns (e.g., ""the amount of water""), ""number"" is more appropriate for countable nouns like ""celebrities."" However, the question focuses on verb agreement, not this distinction.  
2. **""As well as"":** This phrase does not affect subject-verb agreement. The verb still agrees with the singular subject *""the amount""*.  

**Corrected Sentence (for clarity):**  
*""The number of celebrities he has met is also irrelevant, as well as the actual celebrities he met.""*  
(Using ""number"" instead of ""amount"" improves precision, but the original question’s focus is on verb agreement.)"
9,represent,represents,1,"While the individual strands of a linear double helix represent two distinct and separable molecules, this need not be true for circular dna.","While the individual strands of a linear double helix represents two distinct and separable molecules, this need not be true for circular dna.",23,6605,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about DNA structure, specifically comparing linear and circular DNA. 

First, I need to look at the difference between the two sentences. The main difference is the verb in the dependent clause. Sentence A uses ""represent"" and Sentence B uses ""represents"". The subject of that verb is ""the individual strands of a linear double helix"". 

Now, subject-verb agreement is crucial here. The subject is ""strands"", which is plural. So the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Represent"" is the plural form, while ""represents"" is singular. Therefore, Sentence A uses the correct plural form ""represent"", making it grammatically correct. Sentence B incorrectly uses ""represents"" with a plural subject, so it's ungrammatical.

Wait, let me double-check. The subject is ""individual strands"", which is definitely plural. The verb in the dependent clause is ""represent/represents"". So yes, ""strands represent"" is correct. Sentence B has the singular ""represents"", which doesn't agree. 

Another thing to check: the rest of the sentence structure. Both sentences start with ""While..."" and then the main clause is ""this need not be true..."". That part seems okay. The issue is solely in the verb agreement in the dependent clause. 

So conclusion: Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is not because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the dependent clause in both sentences is *""the individual strands of a linear double helix""*. The word *""strands""* is plural, so the verb must agree with a plural subject.  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""represent""** (plural verb form) to match the plural subject *""strands""*.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""represents""** (singular verb form), which clashes with the plural subject.  

The error in Sentence B violates **subject-verb agreement**, a fundamental rule of grammar. The rest of both sentences is structurally sound."
9,represent,represents,1,"While the individual strands of a linear double helix represent two distinct and separable molecules, this need not be true for circular dna.","While the individual strands of a linear double helix represents two distinct and separable molecules, this need not be true for circular dna.",23,6605,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: Sentence A or Sentence B. Both sentences start with ""While the individual strands of a linear double helix..."" and then differ in the verb: ""represents"" in A and ""represent"" in B. The rest of the sentence is the same.

First, I need to figure out the subject-verb agreement here. The main clause in both sentences is ""this need not be true for circular DNA."" That part seems okay. The issue is in the dependent clause starting with ""While."" 

The dependent clause in Sentence A: ""While the individual strands of a linear double helix represents two distinct and separable molecules..."" The verb here is ""represents,"" which is singular. But the subject is ""the individual strands,"" which is plural. So that's a problem. The plural subject should take a plural verb. So ""represent"" would be correct. 

In Sentence B, the verb is ""represent,"" which is plural, matching the plural subject ""strands."" So Sentence B should be correct, and Sentence A incorrect because of the subject-verb disagreement.

Wait, let me double-check. The subject is ""strands,"" right? The phrase ""of a linear double helix"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""strands."" So the core of the subject is ""strands,"" which is plural. Therefore, the verb should be plural: ""represent."" So Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is wrong because it uses the singular ""represents"" with a plural subject.

Another thing to check: sometimes in sentences with ""of,"" the subject can be tricky. For example, ""The number of people is large"" vs. ""A number of people are waiting."" But in this case, ""individual strands"" is clearly the subject, and ""of a linear double helix"" is just giving more info about the strands. So the verb must agree with ""strands,"" which is plural. Therefore, ""represent"" is correct. 

So the answer is that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical due to the subject-verb agreement error.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the dependent clause is *""the individual strands""* (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb *""represents""* (✖️ mismatch with plural subject).  
- Sentence B correctly uses the plural verb *""represent""* (✔️ agrees with plural subject).  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement.  
**Correction:** *""strands ... represent""* (plural + plural)."
14,are,is,1,"Out of the 1, 445 words in the article, 1, 397 are entirely plot material from the primary sources (the novel and its adaptations).","Out of the 1, 445 words in the article, 1, 397 is entirely plot material from the primary sources (the novel and its adaptations).",24,6957,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are about the number of words in an article being plot material from primary sources.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used after ""1,397."" Sentence A uses ""are,"" and Sentence B uses ""is."" 

The subject here is ""1,397,"" which refers to the number of words. Now, when we talk about numbers like this, whether we use singular or plural verbs depends on whether we're considering the number as a single entity or the individual items counted. In this case, ""1,397"" is referring to 1,397 individual words. So, even though it's a large number, each word is a separate unit. That would mean the verb should agree with a plural subject. Therefore, ""are"" would be correct here.

Wait, but sometimes when we use phrases like ""the number of,"" we use a singular verb, but here it's ""out of the 1,445 words... 1,397 are..."" So the subject is ""1,397 words,"" which is plural. So the verb should be plural. So Sentence A is correct with ""are,"" and Sentence B is incorrect because it uses ""is,"" which is singular. 

Let me double-check. If the sentence were ""The number of words is 1,397,"" then ""is"" would be correct because ""number"" is the subject. But here, the subject is the actual count of words, which is plural. So yes, ""are"" is right. 

Another way to test: replace ""1,397"" with a smaller number. For example, ""Out of 10 words, 5 are..."" That sounds correct. If you say ""5 is,"" that's wrong. So the same rule applies here. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Explanation:  
The subject of the verb in the second clause is **""1,397""**, which refers to **plural countable nouns** (words). Since the number represents individual, countable units, the verb must agree with a **plural subject**:  
- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb).  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), which clashes with the plural meaning of ""1,397 words.""  

### Key Grammar Rule:  
Numbers that quantify plural nouns (e.g., *words, books, people*) require **plural verbs**, even if the number itself is large or written as a numeral.  

Example:  
- Correct: *""1,000 words are too many for this task.""*  
- Incorrect: *""1,000 words is too many for this task.""*  

Thus, **Sentence A** follows this rule, while **Sentence B** violates it."
14,are,is,1,"Out of the 1, 445 words in the article, 1, 397 are entirely plot material from the primary sources (the novel and its adaptations).","Out of the 1, 445 words in the article, 1, 397 is entirely plot material from the primary sources (the novel and its adaptations).",24,6957,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about the number of words in an article. The main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs. Here, the subject in question is ""1,397."" Now, ""1,397"" refers to a number of words, right? So even though 1,397 is a large number, it's plural because it's talking about multiple items—words in this case. So the verb should agree with that. 

Wait, but sometimes when we talk about numbers as a single entity, we use a singular verb. For example, ""Three hundred dollars is a lot of money."" But in that case, we're treating the amount as a singular sum. In the sentences given, the number 1,397 is referring to individual words, which are countable and plural. So ""1,397 words"" would take a plural verb. But in the sentences, the word ""words"" isn't repeated after 1,397. It's implied. So the actual subject is ""1,397 (words)"", which is plural. Therefore, the verb should be ""are"" instead of ""is.""

Looking at Sentence A: ""1,397 is entirely plot material..."" That uses ""is,"" which is singular. But since the subject is plural, that's incorrect. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is plural, so that should be correct.

Another way to check is to rephrase the sentence. If we flip it: ""1,397 words are entirely plot material..."" makes sense. Whereas ""1,397 words is..."" doesn't. So the correct verb is ""are."" Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject ""1,397"" refers to plural countable items (words), so the verb must agree in number. Since ""1,397"" represents multiple words, the plural verb **""are""** (Sentence B) is correct. Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb **""is""**, which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
Numbers that represent plural countable nouns (e.g., ""words"") require plural verbs."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both talking about songs from a period and listing some examples. The main difference between them is the verb: ""include"" in Sentence A and ""includes"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""Songs,"" which is plural. So the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Include"" is the base form for plural, and ""includes"" is the third person singular. So ""Songs include"" would be correct, making Sentence A correct. Sentence B uses ""includes,"" which would be for a singular subject like ""The song includes,"" so that's incorrect here.

Wait, let me double-check. The subject is ""Songs,"" right? Yes, ""from this period"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""Songs."" So the main subject is still ""Songs,"" plural. Therefore, the verb should be plural. So Sentence A is correct, B is wrong. 

Also, looking at the examples given, the titles are in quotes but not capitalized. That's a separate issue, but the user is focusing on grammaticality regarding the verb. So the main issue is the subject-verb agreement. 

Another thing to check: sometimes collective nouns can be tricky, but ""songs"" is clearly plural here. So yes, ""include"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because it uses the singular verb with a plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""Songs""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- **""Include""** (plural) correctly matches the plural subject ""Songs.""  
- **""Includes""** (singular) incorrectly pairs with the plural subject, violating subject-verb agreement.  

**Note:** Both sentences have minor formatting issues (e.g., song titles should be capitalized and italicized or enclosed in quotation marks consistently). However, the core grammatical error in Sentence B is the verb form."
4,include,includes,1,"Songs from this period include ""i can't give you anything but love"", ""exactly like you"", and ""on the sunny side of the street.","Songs from this period includes ""i can't give you anything but love"", ""exactly like you"", and ""on the sunny side of the street.",23,6982,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. Both look very similar except for the verb: ""includes"" in A and ""include"" in B.

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""Songs from this period."" The main noun here is ""Songs,"" which is plural. The verb should agree with the plural subject. 

In sentence A, the verb is ""includes,"" which is singular. That doesn't match because ""songs"" is plural. So ""includes"" would be incorrect. 

In sentence B, the verb is ""include,"" which is plural. That matches the plural subject ""Songs,"" so that should be correct. 

Wait, but sometimes prepositional phrases can confuse things. The phrase ""from this period"" is modifying ""Songs,"" but the main subject is still ""Songs."" So the verb should still agree with ""Songs,"" not the prepositional phrase. 

Another thing to check: sometimes collective nouns can be tricky, but ""songs"" is clearly plural. So ""include"" is correct. 

So sentence B is grammatical, and sentence A is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement. 

I should also note that the titles in the sentences have lowercase letters, which might be an issue, but the user is focusing on grammaticality, probably related to the verb. So the main issue is the verb form. 

Yes, that's it. Sentence B is correct.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Songs""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- **Sentence A** uses **""includes""** (singular verb), which incorrectly pairs with the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** uses **""include""** (plural verb), which correctly matches the plural subject **""Songs.""**  

**Note:** Both sentences also have minor formatting issues (song titles should be capitalized and italicized or in quotation marks with standard capitalization), but the core grammatical error in Sentence A is the subject-verb agreement."
7,is,are,2,Discipline in public schools of all levels is generally very tight with school uniforms and morning reveille being the norm.,Discipline in public schools of all levels are generally very tight with school uniforms and morning reveille being the norm.,20,2,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both talking about discipline in public schools. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""discipline,"" which is a singular noun. So the verb should agree with a singular subject. That means ""is"" would be correct. Sentence A uses ""is,"" so that should be correct. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is plural, so that would be incorrect because ""discipline"" is singular.

Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. Let me check the sentence structure again. The subject is ""Discipline in public schools of all levels."" The prepositional phrases ""in public schools"" and ""of all levels"" are modifying ""discipline,"" but the main subject is still ""discipline."" So the verb should still be singular. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes people get confused when there's a phrase between the subject and the verb. For example, if the sentence was ""Discipline in public schools are...,"" someone might mistakenly think ""schools"" is the subject. But no, the subject is ""discipline,"" so the verb must be ""is."" 

So Sentence B is wrong because it uses ""are"" with a singular subject. Sentence A is correct. Let me also check the rest of the sentences to make sure there's no other issue. The phrases ""with school uniforms and morning reveille being the norm"" seem okay. ""Reveille"" is a military wake-up call, so maybe ""morning reveille"" refers to a morning bell or assembly in schools. That part is correct. 

So the conclusion is Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is ungrammatical due to subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""Discipline""** (a singular noun).  
- The verb must agree with the singular subject, so **""is""** (singular) is correct.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""are""** (plural), which clashes with the singular subject ""Discipline.""  

**Key Issue:**  
Subject-verb agreement. Phrases like *""in public schools of all levels""* do not affect the grammatical number of the subject (""Discipline"").  

**Corrected Sentence A:**  
*Discipline in public schools of all levels **is** generally very tight, with school uniforms and morning reveille being the norm.*  

**Why Sentence B Fails:**  
Using **""are""** creates a mismatch between the singular subject and plural verb, making it ungrammatical."
7,is,are,2,Discipline in public schools of all levels is generally very tight with school uniforms and morning reveille being the norm.,Discipline in public schools of all levels are generally very tight with school uniforms and morning reveille being the norm.,20,2,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are about discipline in public schools.

First, I need to look at the subject-verb agreement. The main clause in both sentences starts with ""Discipline in public schools of all levels..."" The verb in Sentence A is ""are,"" and in Sentence B it's ""is."" The subject here is ""Discipline,"" which is singular. So, the verb should agree with a singular subject. That means ""is"" would be correct, making Sentence B grammatical. 

But wait, sometimes people get confused because of the prepositional phrases that come after the subject. In this case, ""in public schools of all levels"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""Discipline."" The key is that the verb should agree with the subject, not the object of the preposition. So even though ""schools"" is plural, the subject is still ""Discipline,"" so the verb should be singular. 

Looking at Sentence A again: ""Discipline... are..."" That's incorrect because ""are"" is plural. Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is singular, so that's correct. 

Another thing to check is the rest of the sentence. Both sentences have the same structure after the verb: ""generally very tight with school uniforms and morning reveille being the norm."" The phrase ""with school uniforms..."" is a prepositional phrase with a gerund clause, which is fine. The word ""reveille"" might be a typo; perhaps they meant ""assembly"" or ""roll call,"" but ""reveille"" is a military term for a morning wake-up call, so maybe it's intentional here to refer to a morning routine. 

So, the main issue is subject-verb agreement. Since ""Discipline"" is singular, ""is"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is not. 

I should also consider if there's any other grammatical issue, but the rest of the sentence structure seems okay. The use of ""with"" followed by a noun phrase and a gerund (""being the norm"") is correct. 

So, the conclusion is that Sentence B is correct because the singular subject ""Discipline"" requires the singular verb ""is.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""**Discipline**"" (singular), not ""public schools"" (plural). Therefore, the verb must agree with the singular subject:  
- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses ""**are**"" (plural verb).  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses ""**is**"" (singular verb).  

**Key Issue:**  
The error in Sentence A arises from mistakenly matching the verb to the plural noun ""schools"" in the prepositional phrase (""in public schools of all levels"") rather than the singular subject ""Discipline.""  

**Note:**  
The rest of the sentence structure (""with school uniforms... being the norm"") is grammatically correct in both sentences. However, ""reveille"" (a military term for a morning bugle call) might be contextually unusual in a school setting, but it is not grammatically incorrect.  

**Conclusion:**  
**Sentence B** is correct due to proper subject-verb agreement."
6,are,is,2,"Plus, essays in project space are actually improperly so called, they are corporate works that are open to ammendment.","Plus, essays in project space is actually improperly so called, they are corporate works that are open to ammendment.",19,177,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about essays in project space being improperly called something.

First, I need to look at the subject-verb agreement. The main clause in both sentences starts with ""essays in project space..."" followed by a verb. In Sentence A, the verb is ""are,"" and in Sentence B, it's ""is."" 

The subject here is ""essays,"" which is plural. ""In project space"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""essays."" The verb must agree with the plural subject ""essays,"" so ""are"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence A uses the correct plural verb ""are,"" while Sentence B incorrectly uses the singular ""is."" That makes Sentence B ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.

Next, I should check for other possible issues. Both sentences have a comma splice—joining two independent clauses with a comma without a conjunction. For example, ""they are corporate works..."" is an independent clause. To fix that, they should use a semicolon or a period instead of a comma. However, the user is only asking about the grammaticality between A and B, so the comma splice is a separate issue but doesn't affect the choice between the two sentences here.

Also, there's a spelling mistake in both sentences: ""ammendment"" should be ""amendment"" with two m's. But again, the user is focusing on grammaticality, not spelling, so that's a side note.

So, the key difference is the verb ""are"" vs. ""is."" Since ""essays"" is plural, Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect. The rest of the sentence structure is the same in both, so the subject-verb agreement is the deciding factor here.
</think>

**Analysis of Sentences A and B:**

1. **Subject-Verb Agreement:**  
   - **Sentence A:** ""essays in project space **are**...""  
     - **Correct.** The subject ""essays"" (plural) agrees with the plural verb ""are.""  
   - **Sentence B:** ""essays in project space **is**...""  
     - **Incorrect.** The plural subject ""essays"" does not agree with the singular verb ""is.""  

2. **Other Issues:**  
   - Both sentences contain a **comma splice** (using a comma to join two independent clauses). This could be fixed with a semicolon, period, or conjunction.  
   - ""ammendment"" is misspelled in both sentences (should be **amendment**).  

**Conclusion:**  
- **Grammatical:** **Sentence A** (despite the comma splice and spelling error).  
- **Ungrammatical:** **Sentence B** (due to subject-verb disagreement).  

**Key Reason:**  
The plural noun ""essays"" requires the plural verb ""are,"" making Sentence B ungrammatical."
6,are,is,2,"Plus, essays in project space are actually improperly so called, they are corporate works that are open to ammendment.","Plus, essays in project space is actually improperly so called, they are corporate works that are open to ammendment.",19,177,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are very similar, except for the verb ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B. The subject here is ""essays in project space,"" so I need to check subject-verb agreement.

First, ""essays"" is plural, so the verb should agree with that. The phrase ""in project space"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""essays,"" so the subject is still ""essays."" Therefore, the correct verb should be ""are"" instead of ""is."" That would make Sentence B correct. 

But wait, let me double-check. Sometimes, even with plural nouns, if there's a singular noun in between, people might get confused. But in this case, ""in project space"" is just a modifier. The main subject is definitely ""essays,"" which is plural. So ""are"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is not.

Also, looking at the rest of the sentences, both have a comma splice. They use a comma to connect two independent clauses: ""Plus, essays...so called,"" and ""they are...ammendment."" That's a separate issue, but the user is specifically asking about the grammaticality related to ""is"" vs. ""are."" So even though both sentences have a comma splice error, the main point here is the subject-verb agreement. So the answer should focus on that.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is ""essays in project space,"" where ""essays"" is plural. The verb must agree with the plural subject, so ""**are**"" (Sentence B) is correct.  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses ""**is**,"" which does not match the plural subject ""essays.""  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Both sentences contain a **comma splice** (joining two independent clauses with only a comma). A semicolon or period would be more appropriate:  
  *""Plus, essays in project space are actually improperly so called; they are corporate works that are open to amendment.""*  
- The word ""ammendment"" is misspelled in both sentences; the correct spelling is **""amendment""**.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Subject-verb agreement (""essays **are**"") makes Sentence B grammatical. Sentence A fails due to ""is."""
5,appear,appears,2,"Buildings with all glass shell appear around the city, with the most prominent examples being the socar tower and flame towers.","Buildings with all glass shell appears around the city, with the most prominent examples being the socar tower and flame towers.",21,400,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about buildings with all glass shells appearing around the city. The main difference between them is the verb form: ""appear"" in Sentence A and ""appears"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""Buildings,"" which is plural. The verb should agree with the plural subject. ""Appear"" is the base form used with plural subjects, while ""appears"" is the third person singular form. So, ""Buildings... appear"" would be correct, making Sentence A correct. Sentence B uses ""appears,"" which doesn't match the plural subject, so it's incorrect.

Another thing to look at is the noun phrase ""all glass shell."" The phrase is used as a modifier for the buildings. The correct structure here would be ""all-glass shell"" with a hyphen to make it a compound adjective. However, both sentences omit the hyphen, which is a minor error but doesn't affect the main subject-verb agreement issue. The user might not be focusing on that, though, since the question is about which sentence is grammatical overall.

Also, proper nouns like ""socar tower"" and ""flame towers"" should be capitalized. Both sentences have them in lowercase, which is another error, but again, the main issue is the verb agreement. The user is probably more concerned with the verb forms here.

So, the key takeaway is that Sentence A uses the correct plural verb form ""appear"" to agree with the plural subject ""Buildings,"" while Sentence B incorrectly uses ""appears."" The other errors (hyphenation and capitalization) are present in both but don't affect the grammaticality as per the main question.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Key Explanation:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - The subject of the sentence is **""Buildings""** (plural). The verb must agree with the plural subject.  
   - **Sentence A** correctly uses **""appear""** (plural verb form).  
   - **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""appears""** (singular verb form), which clashes with the plural subject ""Buildings.""  

2. **Additional Errors in Both Sentences**:  
   - **""all glass shell""** should be hyphenated as **""all-glass shell""** to function as a compound adjective.  
   - Proper nouns like **""socar tower""** and **""flame towers""** should be capitalized (e.g., **""Socar Tower""**, **""Flame Towers""**).  

### Conclusion:  
While both sentences have minor punctuation/capitalization issues, **Sentence B** is ungrammatical due to the subject-verb disagreement. Sentence A is structurally correct."
5,appear,appears,2,"Buildings with all glass shell appear around the city, with the most prominent examples being the socar tower and flame towers.","Buildings with all glass shell appears around the city, with the most prominent examples being the socar tower and flame towers.",21,400,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. Both are very similar, except for the verb ""appears"" in A and ""appear"" in B.

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""Buildings with all glass shell."" Let's break that down. The main noun here is ""Buildings,"" which is plural. The phrase ""with all glass shell"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""Buildings."" Since the subject is plural, the verb should agree with it. 

In sentence A, the verb is ""appears,"" which is singular. That doesn't match the plural subject ""Buildings."" So sentence A is incorrect. 

In sentence B, the verb is ""appear,"" which is plural. That matches the plural subject, so sentence B should be correct. 

Wait, but maybe there's something else. Let me check again. The structure is ""Buildings... appear/appears around the city."" Yes, ""Buildings"" is definitely plural. The prepositional phrase ""with all glass shell"" doesn't change the number of the subject. So the verb must be plural. 

Also, looking at the rest of the sentences, there's a minor issue with ""all glass shell."" It should probably be ""all-glass shells"" to be correct, but the user is focusing on the verb agreement. So even if there's another error, the main point here is the verb. 

So conclusion: Sentence B is grammatical because ""appear"" agrees with the plural subject ""Buildings."" Sentence A is ungrammatical because ""appears"" is singular.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""Buildings""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
  - Sentence A incorrectly uses **""appears""** (singular verb) with the plural subject.  
  - Sentence B correctly uses **""appear""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject.  

**Minor Note:**  
Both sentences have a secondary grammatical issue: **""all glass shell""** should ideally be **""all-glass shells""** (plural ""shells"" to match ""buildings,"" and hyphenated to clarify the compound adjective). However, the primary focus of the question is subject-verb agreement, which makes Sentence B correct.  

**Corrected Version (for reference):**  
*Buildings with all-glass shells appear around the city, with the most prominent examples being the Socar Tower and Flame Towers.*"
8,include,includes,2,Other bodies of water located in the township include richardet lake and the whitewater river.,Other bodies of water located in the township includes richardet lake and the whitewater river.,15,547,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about bodies of water in a township. The main difference between them is the verb: ""include"" in A and ""includes"" in B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""Other bodies of water,"" which is plural because ""bodies"" is the plural of ""body."" So the verb should agree with a plural subject. The verb in sentence A is ""include,"" which is plural, and in B it's ""includes,"" which is singular. That makes me think sentence A is correct because the plural subject matches the plural verb.

Wait, but sometimes there are exceptions. Let me double-check. The structure is ""Other bodies... include..."" Yes, ""bodies"" is definitely plural. The verb should be ""include"" without the ""s."" So sentence B is using the singular form, which doesn't agree with the plural subject. Therefore, sentence B is incorrect.

Another thing to check: sometimes prepositional phrases can confuse the subject. The phrase here is ""located in the township,"" which is describing ""bodies of water."" The subject is still ""bodies,"" not ""township,"" so the verb should still agree with ""bodies."" So even with the prepositional phrase, the verb remains plural. 

Also, proper nouns like ""Richardet Lake"" and ""Whitewater River"" should be capitalized. Both sentences have lowercase, which is a separate issue, but the user is asking about grammaticality related to the verb. So even though there's a capitalization error, the main issue here is subject-verb agreement. 

So conclusion: Sentence A is grammatical because ""include"" matches the plural subject. Sentence B is ungrammatical because ""includes"" is singular, which doesn't agree with the plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""Other bodies of water""** (plural).  
- The verb must agree with the plural subject, so **""include""** (plural) is correct.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""includes""** (singular), which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Note:** Both sentences have capitalization errors (e.g., ""richardet lake"" and ""whitewater river"" should be proper nouns: **Richardet Lake**, **Whitewater River**). However, the core grammatical issue here is subject-verb agreement."
8,include,includes,2,Other bodies of water located in the township include richardet lake and the whitewater river.,Other bodies of water located in the township includes richardet lake and the whitewater river.,15,547,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. Both are very similar, but there's a difference in the verb: ""includes"" vs. ""include"". 

First, I need to identify the subject of each sentence. The subject is ""Other bodies of water located in the township"". The main noun here is ""bodies"", which is plural because ""body"" becomes ""bodies"" in plural. So the subject is plural.

Now, the verb in sentence A is ""includes"", which is singular. That doesn't agree with the plural subject. Sentence B uses ""include"", which is plural. So subject-verb agreement would make sentence B correct. 

Wait, let me double-check. The structure is ""Other bodies... include..."". Yes, ""bodies"" is plural, so the verb should be ""include"". Sentence A is using the singular form, which is incorrect. 

Also, proper nouns like ""Richardet Lake"" and ""Whitewater River"" should be capitalized. Both sentences have them lowercase, but that's a separate issue. The user is asking about grammaticality, which probably refers to the verb agreement. So even though the capitalization is wrong, the main issue is the verb. 

So conclusion: Sentence B is correct because ""include"" matches the plural subject. Sentence A is incorrect because ""includes"" is singular.
</think>

**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: The subject of the sentence is *""Other bodies of water""* (plural). The verb must agree with the plural subject, so the correct form is **""include""** (plural) in Sentence B.  
- **Error in Sentence A**: The use of **""includes""** (singular) incorrectly pairs with the plural subject *""bodies""*.  

### Additional Notes:  
- Both sentences have capitalization errors (*Richardet Lake* and *Whitewater River* should be capitalized as proper nouns). However, the core grammatical issue here is subject-verb agreement.  

**Corrected Sentence B**:  
*Other bodies of water located in the township include Richardet Lake and the Whitewater River.*"

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about Cambodia's midwives per 1,000 live births and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used in the first part: Sentence A uses ""is 6"" and Sentence B uses ""are 6"". The subject here is ""the number of midwives per 1,000 live births"". 

Now, the key point here is subject-verb agreement. The subject is ""the number"", which is singular. Even though ""midwives"" is plural, the actual subject is ""number"", so the verb should agree with that. Therefore, ""the number... is 6"" would be correct. Using ""are"" in Sentence B would be incorrect because ""are"" is plural, and the subject is singular. 

Next, looking at the second part of both sentences: ""the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 110."" Both sentences omit the verb here. It should probably be ""is 1 in 110"" to make it grammatically complete. However, since both sentences are missing the verb in the second clause, they both have an error there. But the user is specifically asking about the difference between A and B, which is the verb in the first part. So even though both sentences have an issue in the second part, the main difference is the ""is"" vs. ""are"" in the first clause.

So, Sentence A correctly uses ""is"" with ""the number"", making it grammatical in that part, while Sentence B incorrectly uses ""are"". The second part of both sentences is ungrammatical because they're missing the verb ""is"". But since the question is about which sentence is grammatical overall, I think the answer would focus on the first part where A is correct and B is not. The second part's error is present in both, so maybe the user is only concerned with the first clause's subject-verb agreement. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that Sentence A is grammatical (except for the second clause's missing verb), and Sentence B is ungrammatical due to ""are"" not agreeing with the singular subject ""number"".
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical** in its first clause but has an **ellipsis** issue in the second clause.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical** due to a **subject-verb agreement error** in the first clause.  

### Explanation:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement (First Clause):**  
   - The subject is *""the number of midwives per 1,000 live births""*. Here, *""the number""* is singular, so it requires the singular verb **""is""** (Sentence A).  
   - Sentence B incorrectly uses **""are""**, which is plural, creating a grammatical error.  

2. **Ellipsis in the Second Clause:**  
   - Both sentences omit the verb in the second clause: *""the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 110.""*  
   - To be fully grammatical, it should read: *""the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women **is** 1 in 110.""*  
   - However, this omission is stylistic (common in informal contexts) and does not affect the primary grammatical distinction between A and B.  

### Conclusion:  
Sentence A is correct in its first clause (subject-verb agreement), while Sentence B is ungrammatical. Both sentences have an ellipsis in the second clause, but this is a secondary issue."
12,is,are,2,"In cambodia the number of midwives per 1, 000 live births is 6 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 110.","In cambodia the number of midwives per 1, 000 live births are 6 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 110.",25,780,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about Cambodia's midwives per 1,000 live births and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used in the first part: Sentence A uses ""are"" while Sentence B uses ""is."" The subject here is ""the number of midwives per 1,000 live births."" 

Hmm, subject-verb agreement is key here. The phrase ""the number of"" usually takes a singular verb because it's referring to a single number, even though ""midwives"" is plural. So ""the number... is"" would be correct. Sentence A uses ""are,"" which is plural, so that's probably incorrect. Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is singular, so that should be correct.

Then, looking at the second part of both sentences: ""the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 110."" Both sentences have this part. Wait, there's a missing verb here. It should be something like ""the lifetime risk... is 1 in 110."" Both sentences omit the verb ""is"" in the second clause. So actually, both sentences have an error there. But the user is only pointing out the difference between ""are"" and ""is"" in the first part. Maybe the main focus is on the first part, and the second part's error is common to both. 

So, even though both sentences have an issue in the second clause, the primary difference is the verb in the first clause. Therefore, Sentence B is correct in using ""is,"" and Sentence A is incorrect with ""are."" The user might not have noticed the missing verb in the second part, but the main grammatical issue they're asking about is the subject-verb agreement in the first part. 

I should mention both issues, though. The main answer is that Sentence B is grammatical (except for the missing verb in the second clause), and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of ""are."" But maybe the user considers the second part's error as a typo or oversight, so the key point is the first part. 

So, to sum up: Sentence A is ungrammatical because ""are"" doesn't agree with ""the number,"" which is singular. Sentence B is grammatical in the first part but has an ellipsis or missing ""is"" in the second part. Depending on how strict the user is, both might have issues, but the main difference is the first verb.
</think>

**Analysis of the Sentences:**

1. **Sentence A** uses *""are""* with *""the number of midwives""*.  
   - **Issue**: The subject *""the number""* is singular, so the verb must agree as *""is""*. Using *""are""* (plural) is incorrect.  
   - **Result**: **Ungrammatical**.

2. **Sentence B** uses *""is""* with *""the number of midwives""*.  
   - **Correction**: This matches the singular subject *""the number""*.  
   - **Result**: **Grammatical** (for the first clause).

**Additional Note**:  
Both sentences omit the verb *""is""* in the second clause (*""the lifetime risk of death [...] **is** 1 in 110""*). This makes both sentences technically incomplete. However, if we assume this is an intentional ellipsis (omission for brevity in parallel structures), **Sentence B** is still the better choice because the first clause is grammatically correct.

**Final Answer**:  
- **Grammatical**: Sentence B (*""is""* agrees with *""the number""*).  
- **Ungrammatical**: Sentence A (*""are""* incorrectly paired with a singular subject)."
12,make,makes,2,"According to ken blanchard, ""four combinations of competence and commitment make up what we call'development level.","According to ken blanchard, ""four combinations of competence and commitment makes up what we call'development level.",16,1211,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are similar except for the verb: ""make up"" in A and ""makes up"" in B. 

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""four combinations of competence and commitment."" The main noun is ""combinations,"" which is plural. So the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Make"" is the plural form, and ""makes"" is singular.

So, Sentence A uses ""make up,"" which is correct because the subject is plural. Sentence B uses ""makes up,"" which is incorrect because it's singular. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and B is not.

Wait, but maybe there's something else. Let me double-check. The structure is ""four combinations... make up."" Yes, combinations are plural. The verb should be plural. So yes, A is correct. Also, looking at the original quote, maybe there's a missing space after ""call'development"" but that's a punctuation error, not related to the verb agreement. The user's main focus is on the verb, so the answer is A is correct, B is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""four combinations of competence and commitment""* (plural), so the verb must agree with a plural subject.  
- Sentence A correctly uses **""make up""** (plural verb).  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""makes up""** (singular verb), which does not match the plural subject.  

**Note:** Both sentences have minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing space after *call'development*), but the critical grammatical error in Sentence B is the subject-verb disagreement."
12,make,makes,2,"According to ken blanchard, ""four combinations of competence and commitment make up what we call'development level.","According to ken blanchard, ""four combinations of competence and commitment makes up what we call'development level.",16,1211,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are similar except for the verb: ""makes"" in A and ""make"" in B.

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""four combinations of competence and commitment."" The main noun is ""combinations,"" which is plural. The verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Makes"" is singular, while ""make"" is plural. So, ""make"" should be correct here. That would make Sentence B correct and A incorrect.

Wait, but maybe there's a trick. Let me double-check. The phrase ""four combinations"" is definitely plural. Even though ""competence and commitment"" are singular, they are part of a prepositional phrase modifying ""combinations."" The verb should agree with ""combinations,"" not the nouns in the prepositional phrase. So yes, ""make"" is correct. 

Also, looking at the original sentences, there's a possible punctuation issue with the quote. The user didn't ask about that, so maybe focusing just on the verb. Sentence A uses ""makes,"" which is wrong because the subject is plural. Sentence B uses ""make,"" which is correct. 

Another thing: the name ""ken blanchard"" should be capitalized as ""Ken Blanchard."" But the user is asking about grammaticality in terms of the verb, so maybe that's a separate issue. However, proper nouns should be capitalized, so both sentences have an error there. But the main focus is on the verb agreement. 

So, the conclusion is Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb agreement error.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""four combinations of competence and commitment,"" which is plural. The verb must agree with the plural subject, so ""make"" (plural) is correct, not ""makes"" (singular).  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Both sentences have minor punctuation/capitalization issues (e.g., ""ken blanchard"" should be ""Ken Blanchard,"" and the closing quotation mark is misplaced). However, the primary grammatical error in Sentence A is the subject-verb disagreement.  
- Sentence B correctly uses ""make"" to match the plural subject ""combinations."""
20,refer,refers,2,"While no details of the agreement have been found to date, copies of the star from that time period refer to wil as ""the st.","While no details of the agreement have been found to date, copies of the star from that time period refers to wil as ""the st.",25,1249,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are almost identical except for the verb in the second part: ""refer"" in Sentence A and ""refers"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, looking at the second part of each sentence, the subject is ""copies of the star from that time period."" The main noun here is ""copies,"" which is plural. The verb should agree with ""copies."" 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""refer,"" which is plural. That matches ""copies,"" so that should be correct. In Sentence B, the verb is ""refers,"" which is singular. That doesn't agree with the plural subject ""copies,"" so Sentence B is likely incorrect.

Wait, let me double-check. The structure is ""copies... refer to wil as..."" Yes, ""copies"" is definitely plural. So ""refer"" is correct. If the subject were singular, like ""copy,"" then ""refers"" would be right. But here it's plural, so Sentence A is grammatical and B is not.

Another thing to check: sometimes prepositional phrases can confuse the subject. The phrase ""of the star from that time period"" is modifying ""copies,"" but the subject is still ""copies."" So the verb must agree with ""copies,"" not ""star"" or ""time period."" 

So the conclusion is Sentence A is correct, Sentence B is incorrect because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the second clause in both sentences is **""copies of the star from that time period""**. The word **""copies""** is plural, so the verb must agree in number.  

- **Sentence A** uses **""refer""** (plural verb), which correctly matches the plural subject **""copies""**.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""refers""** (singular verb), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: Plural subjects require plural verbs.  
- **Why Sentence B Fails**: ""Refers"" (singular) cannot pair with ""copies"" (plural).  

**Corrected Sentence B:**  
*""While no details of the agreement have been found to date, a copy of the star from that time period refers to Wil as 'the st.'""*  
*(Here, ""a copy"" [singular] would justify ""refers"".)*"
20,refer,refers,2,"While no details of the agreement have been found to date, copies of the star from that time period refer to wil as ""the st.","While no details of the agreement have been found to date, copies of the star from that time period refers to wil as ""the st.",25,1249,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are pretty similar except for the verb used: ""refers"" in Sentence A and ""refer"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject in both cases is ""copies of the star from that time period."" The main noun here is ""copies,"" which is plural. So the verb should agree with a plural subject. 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""refers,"" which is singular. That doesn't match because ""copies"" is plural. So Sentence A is likely incorrect. 

Sentence B uses ""refer,"" which is plural. That matches the plural subject ""copies,"" so Sentence B should be correct. 

Wait, let me double-check. The structure of the sentence starts with a dependent clause: ""While no details... to date,"" followed by the main clause. The main clause's subject is definitely ""copies,"" so the verb must be plural. Yep, ""refer"" is correct. 

Also, there's a possible typo with ""wil"" and ""the st."" but the user is focusing on grammar, specifically subject-verb agreement. So even if there are other errors, the key issue here is the verb form. 

So conclusion: Sentence B is grammatical, Sentence A is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the second clause in both sentences is ""copies of the star from that time period."" Since ""copies"" is plural, the verb must agree in number.  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses the singular verb ""refers"" (*""copies ... refers""*), which does not match the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses the plural verb ""refer"" (*""copies ... refer""*), ensuring subject-verb agreement.  

The error in Sentence A violates the rule of grammatical concord (singular/plural agreement). The rest of the sentence contains typos (e.g., ""wil"" and ""the st.""), but the critical grammatical issue lies in the verb form."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both very similar except for the verb: ""remain"" vs. ""remains"". 

First, I need to identify the subject of each sentence. The main clause in both is about the key Benedictine principles. The subject is ""The key Benedictine principles of education and hospitality"". Now, ""principles"" is plural, so the verb should agree with that. 

In sentence A, the verb is ""remain"", which is plural. That makes sense because the subject is plural. In sentence B, the verb is ""remains"", which is singular. That doesn't agree with the plural subject. So sentence B is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. Sometimes, even if the subject seems plural, if it's considered a single entity, the verb might be singular. But in this case, ""principles"" are clearly multiple, so the verb should be plural. 

Another thing to check: prepositional phrases. The phrase ""of education and hospitality"" is modifying ""principles"", but the subject is still ""principles"". So the verb must agree with ""principles"", not the nouns in the prepositional phrase. 

So sentence A is correct because ""principles"" (plural) take ""remain"" (plural verb). Sentence B uses ""remains"" (singular), which doesn't match. Therefore, sentence B is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""The key Benedictine principles of education and hospitality,"" which is plural (""principles""). The verb must agree in number with the subject.  

- **Sentence A** uses **""remain""** (plural verb), which correctly matches the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""remains""** (singular verb), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

The error in Sentence B is a common mistake where intervening phrases (e.g., ""of education and hospitality"") distract from the actual subject. Always identify the core subject (""principles"") to ensure proper verb agreement."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about Benedictine principles. The main difference between them is the verb: ""remains"" in A and ""remain"" in B.

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""The key Benedictine principles of education and hospitality."" The word ""principles"" is plural, so the verb should agree with that. ""Principles"" is the main noun here, and ""of education and hospitality"" is a prepositional phrase modifying it. Sometimes people get confused because of phrases between the subject and verb, but the verb should still agree with the main subject, not the object of the preposition.

In sentence A, the verb is ""remains,"" which is singular. But since the subject is plural (""principles""), that's incorrect. Sentence B uses ""remain,"" which is plural, so that should be correct. 

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe someone could think that ""Benedictine principles"" is a single concept, but no, ""principles"" is definitely plural. Even if there are two principles listed (education and hospitality), they are part of the plural subject. So the verb must be plural. Therefore, sentence B is correct, and A is incorrect because it uses a singular verb with a plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""The key Benedictine principles of education and hospitality""**, which is plural (""principles""). The verb must agree in number with the subject.  

- **Sentence A** uses **""remains""** (singular), which incorrectly pairs with the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** uses **""remain""** (plural), which correctly matches the plural subject.  

The error in Sentence A is a common mistake where intervening phrases (e.g., *""of education and hospitality""*) distract from the true subject. Always identify the core subject (""principles"") to ensure proper agreement."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both starting with ""With the presence of ports,"" and then differing in the verb: ""are"" vs. ""is."" 

First, I need to identify the subject of the verb in each sentence. The main clause in both is about the sources of pollution. Sentence A says ""sea-based sources... are from ships..."" and Sentence B uses ""is."" 

The key here is subject-verb agreement. The subject is ""sea-based sources,"" which is plural because ""sources"" is plural. Therefore, the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Are"" is plural, and ""is"" is singular. So, Sentence A uses ""are,"" which matches the plural subject, making it correct. Sentence B uses ""is,"" which doesn't agree with the plural subject, so it's incorrect.

Wait, let me double-check. The subject is definitely ""sources,"" right? The phrase ""of pollution around the bay"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""sources."" Sometimes prepositional phrases can confuse, but the verb should still agree with the main subject, which is ""sources."" So yes, ""are"" is correct. 

Another way to test is to simplify the sentence: ""Sources are from..."" vs. ""Sources is from..."" The first is correct. So Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is not. 

I should also check if there's any other part of the sentence that might affect the verb, but the introductory phrase ""With the presence of ports"" doesn't impact the subject-verb agreement in the main clause. So the conclusion is solid.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""sea-based sources of pollution around the bay""**, which is plural (""sources""). The verb must agree with the plural subject, so the correct form is **""are""** (Sentence A). Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""**, which is singular and does not match the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-verb agreement**: Plural subject (""sources"") requires a plural verb (""are"").  
- Sentence B violates this rule by pairing a plural subject with a singular verb (""is"")."
13,are,is,2,"With the presence of ports, sea-based sources of pollution around the bay are from ships and motorized boats.","With the presence of ports, sea-based sources of pollution around the bay is from ships and motorized boats.",18,1380,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about sea-based pollution sources around a bay with ports. The difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in A and ""are"" in B.

First, I need to check subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""sea-based sources of pollution around the bay."" Let's break that down. The main noun is ""sources,"" which is plural. The rest are modifiers: ""sea-based"" and ""of pollution around the bay."" So the subject is plural. 

In sentence A, the verb is ""is,"" which is singular. That doesn't match. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is plural. So B should be correct because ""sources are"" agrees in number. 

Wait, but maybe someone could confuse the subject. For example, if the subject was ""presence,"" but no, the main clause starts with ""sea-based sources..."" So the presence of ports is a prepositional phrase at the beginning, not the subject. The real subject is definitely ""sources,"" so plural. 

Therefore, sentence B is grammatical, and A is not because of the singular verb with a plural subject. I should also check if there's any other possible errors, but the main issue here is the subject-verb agreement. Yep, that's it. So the answer is that sentence B is correct, and A is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""sea-based sources of pollution around the bay""**, which is plural (""sources""). The verb must agree with the plural subject, so the correct form is **""are""** (Sentence B). Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb **""is""**, which does not match the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: Plural subjects require plural verbs.  
- **Correction**: ""Sources **are**"" (not ""is"").  

Thus, **Sentence B** is correct."
7,have,has,2,Engineers committing a stop signal violation automatically have their federal certification suspended and are frequently fired.,Engineers committing a stop signal violation automatically has their federal certification suspended and are frequently fired.,16,1463,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about engineers committing a stop signal violation and the consequences. 

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used in the first part. Sentence A uses ""have"" and Sentence B uses ""has"". The subject here is ""Engineers committing a stop signal violation"". 

Wait, so the subject is plural, right? ""Engineers"" is plural, and ""committing a stop signal violation"" is a participle phrase modifying the noun. So the main noun is ""Engineers"", which is plural. Therefore, the verb should agree with a plural subject. 

In Sentence A, ""automatically have their federal certification suspended"" – ""have"" is the plural form, which matches ""Engineers"". That seems correct. 

Sentence B uses ""has"", which is singular. So ""Engineers... automatically has..."" – that doesn't agree in number. The subject is plural, so the verb should be plural. Therefore, Sentence B is incorrect.

Another thing to check is the rest of the sentence. Both sentences end with ""and are frequently fired."" The ""are"" is plural, which again matches the plural subject. So in Sentence B, the first verb is singular (""has"") but the second verb is plural (""are""), which creates inconsistency. That's another point against Sentence B.

So putting it all together: Sentence A uses the correct plural verb ""have"" to agree with the plural subject ""Engineers"", while Sentence B incorrectly uses the singular ""has"". Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A is grammatical.**  
- **Sentence B is ungrammatical.**  

**Explanation:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The subject ""Engineers"" (plural) requires a plural verb. In Sentence A, ""have"" correctly agrees with the plural subject. In Sentence B, ""has"" (singular) incorrectly disagrees with ""Engineers.""  
- **Consistency:** Sentence A maintains consistency with the plural verb ""have"" and the plural verb ""are"" later in the sentence. Sentence B inconsistently mixes singular ""has"" with plural ""are,"" worsening the error.  

**Key Issue:**  
The error in Sentence B (""has"") violates grammatical subject-verb agreement. Plural subjects require plural verbs."
7,have,has,2,Engineers committing a stop signal violation automatically have their federal certification suspended and are frequently fired.,Engineers committing a stop signal violation automatically has their federal certification suspended and are frequently fired.,16,1463,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: Sentence A or Sentence B. The sentences are about engineers committing a stop signal violation and the consequences. 

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used: Sentence A uses ""has"" and Sentence B uses ""have"". The subject here is ""Engineers committing a stop signal violation"". I need to determine if the subject is singular or plural because that affects the verb choice.

The subject phrase starts with ""Engineers"", which is plural. The participle phrase ""committing a stop signal violation"" is modifying ""Engineers"", so the entire subject is still plural. Therefore, the verb should agree with a plural subject. 

In Sentence A, ""automatically has their federal certification suspended"" uses ""has"", which is singular. That doesn't agree with the plural subject. Then the second part of the sentence is ""are frequently fired"", which is plural. So there's inconsistency here. The first verb is singular, the second is plural, but the subject is plural throughout. That makes Sentence A incorrect.

Sentence B uses ""have"", which is plural, matching the plural subject ""Engineers"". Then the second verb ""are"" is also plural, so both verbs agree. Therefore, Sentence B is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes with collective nouns or phrases, it can be tricky. But in this case, ""Engineers"" is clearly plural. The participle phrase doesn't change the number. So the verb should be ""have"". 

Another thing to check is the pronoun ""their"". In both sentences, it's ""their"", which is correct because ""Engineers"" is plural. So that's consistent. 

So the error in Sentence A is the singular ""has"" with a plural subject. Sentence B correctly uses ""have"". Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The subject of the sentence is **""Engineers committing a stop signal violation""**, which is plural (referring to multiple engineers). The verb must agree with the plural subject:  
- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses the singular verb **""has""** (*""Engineers ... has""*), which does not match the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses the plural verb **""have""** (*""Engineers ... have""*), ensuring subject-verb agreement.  

Additionally, the plural pronoun **""their""** aligns with the plural subject in both sentences, but the verb error in Sentence A makes it ungrammatical.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement:** Plural subjects require plural verbs (*engineers **have***, not *engineers **has***)."
7,are,is,2,"The soils in the aspen parkland biome are also quite fertile, especially around edmonton and saskatoon.","The soils in the aspen parkland biome is also quite fertile, especially around edmonton and saskatoon.",16,1924,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. Both are about the soils in the aspen parkland biome being fertile, especially around Edmonton and Saskatoon. The main difference between them is the verb: Sentence A uses ""are"" and Sentence B uses ""is"". 

First, I need to check subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""The soils in the aspen parkland biome"". The main noun here is ""soils"", which is plural. So the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Are"" is the plural form of ""to be"", and ""is"" is singular. Therefore, Sentence A uses ""are"", which matches the plural subject, making it correct. Sentence B uses ""is"", which is singular, so that would be incorrect.

Wait, but maybe someone could think the subject is ""aspen parkland biome"" which is singular. But no, the subject is ""soils"", and ""in the aspen parkland biome"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""soils"". So the verb should agree with ""soils"", not the biome. So definitely, ""soils are"" is correct. 

Also, looking at the cities, Edmonton and Saskatoon should be capitalized. Both sentences have them lowercase, which is incorrect. But the user is asking about grammaticality between A and B, so maybe the focus is on the subject-verb agreement rather than the capitalization. The user might not have mentioned that, but perhaps they consider it a separate issue. However, in standard grammar, proper nouns should be capitalized. But since both sentences have the same error, maybe the user is only concerned with the verb agreement. 

So, the main issue here is ""are"" vs. ""is"". Sentence A is correct, Sentence B is incorrect. The answer should point out that Sentence A has correct subject-verb agreement, while Sentence B does not. Also, note the capitalization issue, but since both have it, it's not the deciding factor here.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement:**  
  The subject of the sentence is ""soils"" (plural), so the verb must agree with the plural form.  
  - Sentence A correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb).  
  - Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), which does not match the plural subject ""soils.""  

### Additional Note:  
Both sentences contain **capitalization errors** (""edmonton"" and ""saskatoon"" should be capitalized as proper nouns: **Edmonton** and **Saskatoon**). However, this does not affect the grammaticality distinction between the two sentences, as the primary focus is on subject-verb agreement.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Always ensure the verb matches the number (singular/plural) of its subject."
7,are,is,2,"The soils in the aspen parkland biome are also quite fertile, especially around edmonton and saskatoon.","The soils in the aspen parkland biome is also quite fertile, especially around edmonton and saskatoon.",16,1924,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Let me read them again carefully.

Sentence A: ""The soils in the aspen parkland biome is also quite fertile, especially around edmonton and saskatoon.""

Sentence B: ""The soils in the aspen parkland biome are also quite fertile, especially around edmonton and saskatoon.""

Hmm, the main difference between the two is the verb: ""is"" in A and ""are"" in B. The subject here is ""soils,"" which is plural. So, the verb should agree with the subject in number. Let me break it down.

In Sentence A, the subject is ""soils,"" which is plural. The verb used is ""is,"" which is singular. That's a problem because a plural subject needs a plural verb. So ""soils are"" would be correct. Therefore, Sentence A has a subject-verb agreement error.

Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is plural, matching the plural subject ""soils."" So that should be correct. 

Wait, but let me check if there's anything else. The rest of the sentence structure seems the same. The phrase ""especially around edmonton and saskatoon"" is a prepositional phrase modifying the adjective ""fertile."" The cities should be capitalized, though. Edmonton and Saskatoon are proper nouns, so they need capital letters. But the user didn't mention that, so maybe the focus is just on the subject-verb agreement. 

So, even though there are capitalization errors in both sentences, the main issue here is the verb agreement. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is not. 

I should also note that the user might be testing subject-verb agreement, especially with intervening phrases. The phrase ""in the aspen parkland biome"" comes between the subject ""soils"" and the verb, which could confuse someone. But the verb still needs to agree with ""soils,"" not ""biome."" So yes, ""are"" is correct. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes collective nouns can be tricky, but ""soils"" is clearly plural. So no issues there. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect due to the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement Error in Sentence A:**  
  The subject ""soils"" is plural, but the verb ""is"" is singular. This mismatch violates grammatical rules.  

- **Correct Agreement in Sentence B:**  
  The plural verb ""are"" correctly matches the plural subject ""soils.""  

### Additional Notes:  
- Both sentences have **capitalization errors** (""edmonton"" and ""saskatoon"" should be capitalized as proper nouns: **Edmonton** and **Saskatoon**).  
- The intervening phrase *""in the aspen parkland biome""* does not affect subject-verb agreement. The verb must agree with the main subject (""soils""), not the singular noun ""biome.""  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Always ensure the verb matches the **number** (singular/plural) of the subject, even when phrases separate them."
18,are,is,2,"Within the currently favoured cosmological lambda-cdm model, small objects (consisting of dark matter and gas) are the first to form.","Within the currently favoured cosmological lambda-cdm model, small objects (consisting of dark matter and gas) is the first to form.",20,2285,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are almost identical except for the verb used: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to identify the subject of the verb in each sentence. The main clause here is ""small objects ... are/is the first to form."" The subject is ""small objects,"" which is plural because ""objects"" is plural and modified by ""small."" 

In English, subject-verb agreement is crucial. Plural subjects take plural verbs, and singular subjects take singular verbs. The verb ""are"" is the plural form of ""to be,"" while ""is"" is the singular form. Since ""small objects"" is plural, the correct verb should be ""are.""

Looking at Sentence A: ""small objects ... are the first to form."" That's correct because the plural subject matches the plural verb. 

Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is singular. That would be incorrect here because the subject is plural. So Sentence B is ungrammatical due to the subject-verb disagreement.

I should also check if there's anything else that might affect this, like intervening phrases. The part in parentheses is ""(consisting of dark matter and gas)."" That's a participial phrase modifying ""small objects,"" but it doesn't change the number of the subject. The core subject remains ""small objects,"" which is plural. 

Another thing to consider is whether ""the first to form"" could be influencing the verb, but ""the first"" here is part of the predicate adjective phrase. The verb still needs to agree with the subject, not the predicate. 

So, the conclusion is that Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect because of the verb form ""is"" not agreeing with the plural subject ""small objects.""
</think>

Both sentences are nearly identical except for the verb used (""are"" vs. ""is""). Here's the breakdown:

- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
  The subject ""small objects"" is plural, so the plural verb ""are"" agrees correctly.  
  Structure: *Small objects ...* (plural subject) → *are* (plural verb).

- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  
  The plural subject ""small objects"" incorrectly pairs with the singular verb ""is,"" violating subject-verb agreement.  

**Key Issue**: The phrase in parentheses (""consisting of dark matter and gas"") does not affect the subject's plurality. The core subject (""small objects"") remains plural, requiring a plural verb.  

**Final Answer**:  
- **Sentence A** is **correct**.  
- **Sentence B** is **incorrect**."
18,are,is,2,"Within the currently favoured cosmological lambda-cdm model, small objects (consisting of dark matter and gas) are the first to form.","Within the currently favoured cosmological lambda-cdm model, small objects (consisting of dark matter and gas) is the first to form.",20,2285,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about the lambda-cdm model in cosmology. Let me start by reading both sentences carefully.

Sentence A: ""Within the currently favoured cosmological lambda-cdm model, small objects (consisting of dark matter and gas) is the first to form.""

Sentence B: ""Within the currently favoured cosmological lambda-cdm model, small objects (consisting of dark matter and gas) are the first to form.""

Hmm, the main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" vs. ""are"". The subject here is ""small objects"", right? Let's check the subject-verb agreement. The subject ""small objects"" is plural because ""objects"" is plural and ""small"" is just an adjective. So, the verb should agree with a plural subject. 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""is"", which is singular. That doesn't match. So that's probably incorrect. Sentence B uses ""are"", which is plural, so that should be correct. 

Wait, but there's a parenthetical phrase: ""(consisting of dark matter and gas)"". Parentheticals can sometimes confuse people about the subject. But in terms of grammar, the subject is still ""small objects"", and the part in parentheses is just adding extra information. So the verb should still agree with ""small objects"", not the stuff inside the parentheses. 

Let me think of another example. If I say, ""The books (including the one you lent me) are on the table."" Here, ""books"" is plural, so ""are"" is correct. If I used ""is"", it would be wrong. Similarly, in Sentence A, using ""is"" with ""small objects"" is incorrect. 

Another thing to check: sometimes collective nouns can be tricky, but ""small objects"" is clearly plural. There's no collective noun here. So yes, ""are"" is the right choice. 

Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""small objects""** (plural).  
- The verb must agree in number with the subject.  
  - Sentence A incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb) with the plural subject **""small objects""**.  
  - Sentence B correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject.  

The parenthetical phrase **""(consisting of dark matter and gas)""** does not affect subject-verb agreement. The core error in Sentence A is the mismatch between the plural subject and the singular verb."
15,sounds,sound,2,"Claims of wiki-hounding or not, the use of multiple accounts to edit different topics sounds like sock behavior to me.","Claims of wiki-hounding or not, the use of multiple accounts to edit different topics sound like sock behavior to me.",20,2300,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. Both sentences are very similar except for the verb ""sounds"" in A and ""sound"" in B. The subject of the verb is ""the use of multiple accounts to edit different topics."" 

First, I need to determine if the subject is singular or plural. The main noun here is ""use,"" which is singular. Even though ""multiple accounts"" follows, that's part of a prepositional phrase modifying ""use."" So the subject is singular.

In sentence A, the verb is ""sounds,"" which is singular. That matches the singular subject ""use."" In sentence B, the verb is ""sound,"" which is plural. Since the subject is singular, ""sound"" would be incorrect. Therefore, sentence A is grammatical, and B is not.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come after the subject. Let me double-check. The structure is ""the use... sounds..."" Yes, ""use"" is the subject, so the verb should agree with that. So yes, A is correct. B is wrong because it uses a plural verb with a singular subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb is *""the use of multiple accounts to edit different topics""*. The core noun here is **""use""** (singular), not ""accounts"" (plural). Since the subject is singular, the verb must agree in number:  
- **""sounds""** (singular) in Sentence A is correct.  
- **""sound""** (plural) in Sentence B is incorrect.  

The phrase *""Claims of wiki-hounding or not""* is a parenthetical element and does not affect subject-verb agreement. Thus, Sentence A follows proper grammar, while Sentence B violates subject-verb agreement."
15,sounds,sound,2,"Claims of wiki-hounding or not, the use of multiple accounts to edit different topics sounds like sock behavior to me.","Claims of wiki-hounding or not, the use of multiple accounts to edit different topics sound like sock behavior to me.",20,2300,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both very similar except for the verb ""sound"" vs. ""sounds"". 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The main clause starts with ""the use of multiple accounts..."". So the subject here is ""the use"". ""Of multiple accounts"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""use"". Then there's another prepositional phrase, ""to edit different topics"". So the core subject is ""the use"", which is singular.

In sentence A, the verb is ""sound"", which is plural. In sentence B, it's ""sounds"", which is singular. Since the subject ""use"" is singular, the verb should agree in number. Therefore, ""sounds"" is correct. So sentence B is grammatical, and A is not. 

Wait, but maybe the user is confused because ""multiple accounts"" is plural. But that's part of the prepositional phrase, not the subject. The key is that the subject is ""the use"", which is singular. So the verb should be ""sounds"". Yeah, that makes sense. So sentence B is correct.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the main clause is *""the use of multiple accounts""*. Here, **""the use""** is the singular core subject, and the verb must agree with it in number. The phrase *""of multiple accounts to edit different topics""* is a prepositional phrase modifying ""use"" and does not affect the verb's number.  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses the plural verb *""sound""* (✗).  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses the singular verb *""sounds""* (✓).  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Verbs agree with their grammatical subject, not with modifying phrases."
13,are,is,2,"As with wild things 2, many elements of the film's plot are similar to those of the original, including the threesome scene.","As with wild things 2, many elements of the film's plot is similar to those of the original, including the threesome scene.",22,2934,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about comparing elements of a film's plot to the original, specifically mentioning ""wild things 2"" and a threesome scene.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used in the main clause. Sentence A uses ""are similar,"" while Sentence B uses ""is similar."" The subject of the verb is ""many elements of the film's plot."" 

Now, ""many elements"" is a plural noun phrase because ""elements"" is plural. The verb needs to agree with the subject in number. So, plural subjects take plural verbs. ""Are"" is the plural form of the verb ""to be,"" and ""is"" is the singular form. 

In Sentence A, ""many elements... are similar"" – that's correct because ""are"" matches the plural subject. In Sentence B, ""many elements... is similar"" – that's incorrect because ""is"" is singular, and the subject is plural. 

I should also check if there are any other issues. The phrase ""As with wild things 2"" is a prepositional phrase starting with ""as with,"" which is correctly used here to draw a comparison. The rest of the sentence structure seems okay. The part after the comma, ""including the threesome scene,"" is a participial phrase that adds more information, which is correctly attached to the main clause.

So, the key issue is subject-verb agreement. Sentence B has a singular verb with a plural subject, making it ungrammatical. Sentence A is correct because the verb agrees with the plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""many elements of the film's plot""**, which is plural. The verb must agree with the plural subject, so **""are""** (plural) is correct in Sentence A. Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular), violating subject-verb agreement.  

**Key Error in Sentence B:**  
- **""many elements... is similar""** → Plural subject + singular verb = mismatch.  

The rest of the sentence structure (e.g., ""As with Wild Things 2,"" and the participial phrase ""including..."") is grammatically sound in both sentences."
13,are,is,2,"As with wild things 2, many elements of the film's plot are similar to those of the original, including the threesome scene.","As with wild things 2, many elements of the film's plot is similar to those of the original, including the threesome scene.",22,2934,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both comparing elements of a film's plot to the original, mentioning a threesome scene. The main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""many elements of the film's plot."" The word ""elements"" is plural, so the verb should agree with that. ""Many elements"" is definitely plural, so the verb should be ""are"" instead of ""is."" That would make Sentence B correct and Sentence A incorrect.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come after the subject. Let me make sure. The structure here is ""many elements... are similar."" The phrase ""of the film's plot"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""elements,"" but it doesn't change the number of the subject. So the verb must still agree with ""elements,"" which is plural. Therefore, ""are"" is correct. 

Another thing to check: the initial phrase ""As with Wild Things 2"" is a prepositional phrase setting up a comparison, but it doesn't affect the subject-verb agreement in the main clause. The main clause starts with ""many elements,"" so that's the key part. 

Also, looking at the rest of the sentence: ""including the threesome scene"" is a participial phrase that adds extra information but doesn't influence the verb choice. So the core sentence is ""many elements... are similar,"" which is correct. 

So, Sentence B uses ""are"" which matches the plural subject ""elements,"" making it grammatical. Sentence A incorrectly uses ""is,"" which doesn't agree with the plural subject, making it ungrammatical. 

I should also check if there are any other issues. For example, capitalization of ""Wild Things 2"" as a title. Both sentences have it lowercase, which might be an error, but the user didn't mention that. The focus is on the verb agreement. So sticking to that, the answer is clear.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""many elements of the film's plot,"" where ""elements"" is plural. The verb must agree in number with the plural subject, so ""**are**"" (Sentence B) is correct. Sentence A incorrectly uses ""**is**,"" which does not match the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: ""Elements"" (plural) requires ""are,"" not ""is.""  
- Sentence B: ""many elements ... **are** similar"" ✅  
- Sentence A: ""many elements ... **is** similar"" ❌  

No other grammatical errors are present in the sentences."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb used: Sentence A uses ""are"" and Sentence B uses ""is"". 

First, I need to identify the subject of the sentence to determine subject-verb agreement. The sentence starts with ""Other topics addressed in the story collection..."" So the main subject here is ""Other topics"". ""Topics"" is plural, so the verb should agree with a plural subject.

In Sentence A, the verb is ""are"", which is plural. That matches with ""topics"". Sentence B uses ""is"", which is singular. That would be incorrect because the subject is plural. 

But wait, maybe the user is confused because after the verb, there's a list: ""pain and eroticism and different political and cultural values..."" So maybe someone might think the verb is referring to the list after it. But no, in English, the verb agrees with the subject, not the complement. The structure is ""Other topics are..."" followed by the list of topics. So even though the list might contain compound elements, the verb still needs to agree with the subject ""topics"".

So Sentence A is correct because ""are"" matches the plural subject ""topics"". Sentence B is incorrect because ""is"" is singular and doesn't agree with the plural subject. 

I should also check if there's any other possible confusion. For example, sometimes when the subject is a collective noun or when the complement is a singular noun, but in this case, the subject is clearly plural. So the answer should be that Sentence A is grammatical and Sentence B is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""Other topics""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), which clashes with the plural subject ""topics.""  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement. Plural subjects require plural verbs."
7,are,is,2,Other topics addressed in the story collection are pain and eroticism and different political and cultural values attributed to sexuality.,Other topics addressed in the story collection is pain and eroticism and different political and cultural values attributed to sexuality.,20,3347,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about topics addressed in a story collection. The main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""Other topics,"" which is plural. The verb should agree with the subject in number. Since ""topics"" is plural, the verb should be plural as well. ""Are"" is the plural form of ""to be,"" so Sentence B uses ""are,"" which matches the plural subject. Sentence A uses ""is,"" which is singular, so that would be incorrect here.

Wait, but let me make sure. Sometimes, even if the subject seems plural, there might be cases where it's considered singular. For example, if the subject is a collective noun. But ""topics"" is clearly plural here. The sentence starts with ""Other topics,"" so the verb should definitely be ""are."" 

Looking at the rest of the sentence, after ""are,"" there's a list of items: pain, eroticism, and different political and cultural values. These are all plural items, but the verb is determined by the subject, not the predicate nominatives. So even if the items listed after the verb are singular or plural, the verb still needs to agree with the subject. 

So Sentence A is incorrect because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject. Sentence B is correct because it uses ""are."" 

I should also check if there's any other possible confusion. For example, sometimes when the subject is separated from the verb by a phrase, people might make a mistake. In this case, ""addressed in the story collection"" is a participial phrase modifying ""topics,"" but the subject is still ""topics,"" so the verb should still be plural. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes compound subjects can be tricky. But here, the subject is ""topics,"" and the rest are the things being addressed. So no, the verb is definitely determined by ""topics."" 

Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical due to subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""Other topics,"" which is plural. The verb must agree with the subject in number.  

- **Sentence A** uses the singular verb *""is""* (""Other topics **is**...""), which incorrectly pairs a plural subject with a singular verb.  
- **Sentence B** uses the plural verb *""are""* (""Other topics **are**...""), which correctly matches the plural subject.  

The error in Sentence A violates the rule of **subject-verb agreement**. The rest of the sentence (the list of topics) does not affect this agreement, as the verb must always correspond to the main subject (""topics"").  

**Correct Sentence:**  
*Other topics addressed in the story collection **are** pain and eroticism and different political and cultural values attributed to sexuality.*"

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both very similar except for the verb after ""a list of links to drive-in theatres."" Sentence A uses ""is"" and Sentence B uses ""are.""

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, the key here is to identify the subject in each case.

Looking at Sentence A: ""a list of links to drive-in theatres is most definitely not."" The subject here is ""a list,"" which is singular. The phrase ""of links to drive-in theatres"" is a prepositional phrase modifying the subject but doesn't change its number. So the verb should be singular ""is."" That makes sense. 

Sentence B uses ""are"" instead. If the subject were plural, like ""lists,"" then ""are"" would be correct. But since the subject is ""a list,"" which is singular, ""are"" would be incorrect. So Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused when there's a prepositional phrase with a plural noun after a singular subject. For example, ""The list of items is long"" vs. ""The list of items are long."" The correct one is ""is"" because the subject is ""list,"" not ""items."" So the same logic applies here. The list is the subject, so the verb should agree with ""list,"" not ""links.""

Another thing to check: the user mentioned ""most definitly not."" Wait, ""definitly"" is misspelled. It should be ""definitely."" But the question is about grammaticality, not spelling. The user might have a typo, but since both sentences have the same misspelling, it's probably not the focus here. The main issue is the verb agreement.

So, conclusion: Sentence A is correct because ""a list"" is singular and takes ""is."" Sentence B incorrectly uses ""are,"" which doesn't agree with the singular subject. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Analysis:**

The key difference between the two sentences lies in **subject-verb agreement**:

- **Sentence A** uses ""is"" (singular verb), which correctly agrees with the singular subject ""a list of links to drive-in theatres.""  
- **Sentence B** uses ""are"" (plural verb), which incorrectly disagrees with the singular subject ""a list.""  

The phrase ""of links to drive-in theatres"" is a prepositional phrase modifying the singular noun ""list."" The verb must agree with the grammatical subject (""list""), not the plural object of the preposition (""links"").  

**Conclusion:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical** (due to ""are"" instead of ""is"").  

**Note:** Both sentences contain a spelling error (""definitly"" → ""definitely""), but this does not affect the grammaticality judgment here."
25,is,are,2,"A list (or category, or both) of notable drive-in theatres might be appropriate, but a list of links to drive-in theatres is most definitly not.","A list (or category, or both) of notable drive-in theatres might be appropriate, but a list of links to drive-in theatres are most definitly not.",25,3824,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, and the difference between them is the verb used: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B. The subject in question is ""a list of links to drive-in theatres."" 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, the key here is to identify the subject of the verb in question. 

Looking at the structure of the sentence, the main clause after ""but"" is ""a list of links to drive-in theatres are/is most definitely not."" The subject here is ""a list,"" which is singular. The phrase ""of links to drive-in theatres"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""list."" Even though ""links"" is plural, the subject itself is still ""list,"" which is singular. Therefore, the verb should agree with ""list,"" not ""links."" 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""are,"" which is plural. That doesn't match the singular subject ""list."" In Sentence B, the verb is ""is,"" which is singular, so it agrees with ""list."" That makes Sentence B correct and Sentence A incorrect.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused when there's a prepositional phrase with a plural noun after a singular subject. For example, ""The group of students is/are studying."" In British English, sometimes plural verbs are used with collective nouns, but in American English, it's usually singular. However, in this case, ""a list"" is a singular collective noun, so regardless of the prepositional phrase, the verb should be singular. 

Another way to test is to remove the prepositional phrase: ""A list [...] is most definitely not."" That sounds correct. If you use ""are,"" it would be ""A list are..."" which is clearly wrong. So yes, Sentence B is correct. 

Also, the user might have a typo in ""definitly"" which should be ""definitely,"" but the question is about grammar, not spelling. So focusing on the verb agreement, the answer is Sentence B is grammatical, Sentence A is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the second clause is *""a list of links to drive-in theatres""*. Here, the core subject is **""a list""** (singular), not ""links"" (plural). The verb must agree with the singular subject ""list,"" so the correct verb is **""is""** (singular) as in Sentence B.  

Sentence A incorrectly uses **""are""** (plural), which disagrees with the singular subject. This violates subject-verb agreement rules.  

**Note:** Both sentences contain a spelling error (*""definitly""* should be *""definitely""*), but this does not affect grammaticality. The focus here is on verb agreement."
7,depends,depend,2,The outcome of the players' actions depends on the choices and card play of the other players in the same location.,The outcome of the players' actions depend on the choices and card play of the other players in the same location.,21,4097,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about the outcome depending on choices and card play. The main difference is the verb: ""depends"" in A and ""depend"" in B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The subject is what determines if the verb should be singular or plural. The sentence starts with ""The outcome of the players' actions..."" So the main noun here is ""outcome,"" right? ""Of the players' actions"" is a prepositional phrase modifying the subject, but the subject itself is ""outcome,"" which is singular. 

So, the verb should agree with the singular subject. That means ""depends"" would be correct. Sentence A uses ""depends,"" so that should be correct. Sentence B uses ""depend,"" which is plural, so that would be incorrect because the subject is singular. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused when there's a prepositional phrase between the subject and verb. Like, they might think ""players' actions"" is the subject, but it's actually part of the phrase describing the outcome. So the key is to identify the true subject, which is ""outcome."" 

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. Remove the prepositional phrase: ""The outcome... depends on the choices..."" Yep, that sounds right. If it were ""The outcomes depend...,"" then ""depend"" would be correct. But here it's singular, so ""depends"" is right. 

So sentence A is grammatical, and B is ungrammatical because of subject-verb agreement. Let me make sure there's no other tricky parts. The part after ""depends on"" is ""the choices and card play of the other players."" That's a compound object, but it doesn't affect the verb. The verb only needs to agree with the subject ""outcome."" 

Yep, I think that's solid. So the answer is A is correct, B is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""The outcome""** (singular), not ""the players' actions"" (plural). The verb must agree with the singular subject ""outcome,"" so the correct form is **""depends""** (singular).  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""depends""** to match the singular subject.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""depend""** (plural), which clashes with the singular subject.  

**Key Tip:** Ignore prepositional phrases (e.g., *""of the players' actions""*) when determining subject-verb agreement. Focus on the core subject (""outcome"") to choose the correct verb form."
7,depends,depend,2,The outcome of the players' actions depends on the choices and card play of the other players in the same location.,The outcome of the players' actions depend on the choices and card play of the other players in the same location.,21,4097,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about the outcome depending on other players' choices and card play.

First, I need to figure out the subject of each sentence. The main clause in both is about ""the outcome."" Let's break down Sentence A: ""The outcome of the players' actions depend on the choices..."" The verb here is ""depend."" Now, the subject is ""the outcome,"" which is singular. So the verb should agree with a singular subject. ""Depends"" would be correct for a singular subject, but Sentence A uses ""depend,"" which is plural. That seems wrong. 

Then, looking at Sentence B: ""The outcome... depends on the choices..."" Here, the verb is ""depends,"" which is singular. Since the subject is ""outcome,"" which is singular, this should be correct. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused because of prepositional phrases. The phrase ""of the players' actions"" comes after ""outcome,"" but that doesn't change the subject. The subject is still ""outcome,"" so the verb must agree with that. So Sentence A is incorrect because it uses plural ""depend"" with a singular subject, and Sentence B is correct with ""depends.""

Another thing to check: are there any other parts of the sentence that might affect subject-verb agreement? The rest of the sentence talks about ""the choices and card play of the other players."" But that's the object of the preposition ""on,"" so it doesn't influence the verb. The verb's number is solely determined by the subject ""outcome.""

So, conclusion: Sentence B is grammatical, Sentence A is not. The key is subject-verb agreement. The confusion might come from the plural noun ""actions"" near the subject, but the actual subject is singular.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""The outcome""** (singular), not ""the players' actions"" (plural). Therefore, the verb must agree with the singular subject:  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses **""depend""** (plural verb).  
- Sentence B correctly uses **""depends""** (singular verb).  

The confusion often arises because the prepositional phrase **""of the players' actions""** follows the subject, but it does not affect subject-verb agreement. The verb must always match the grammatical number of the subject itself (**""outcome""**)."
15,continues,continue,2,The model 92 was designed in 1972 and production of many variants in different calibers continues today.,The model 92 was designed in 1972 and production of many variants in different calibers continue today.,17,4448,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both about the Model 92 being designed in 1972 and the production of variants continuing. The difference is in the verbs ""continues"" (Sentence A) and ""continue"" (Sentence B). 

First, I need to figure out the subject that the verbs ""continues"" or ""continue"" are referring to. The sentence structure is a compound sentence connected by ""and."" The first part is ""The model 92 was designed in 1972,"" which is straightforward. The second part is about the production of variants. 

Looking at Sentence A: ""production of many variants... continues today."" The subject here is ""production,"" which is singular. So the verb should agree with a singular subject, hence ""continues"" is correct. 

In Sentence B, they use ""continue,"" which is plural. But the subject is still ""production,"" not the variants. The phrase ""of many variants in different calibers"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""production,"" but it doesn't change the subject's number. The subject remains singular, so ""continue"" would be incorrect here.

Wait, but maybe someone could think that ""many variants"" is the subject? Let me check. The structure is ""production of many variants..."" So ""production"" is the main noun, and ""of many variants"" is a prepositional phrase that describes what the production consists of. Therefore, the verb must agree with ""production,"" which is singular. So ""continues"" is correct. 

Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because it uses the plural verb ""continue"" with a singular subject ""production.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the second clause is **""production""** (singular), not ""variants"" (plural). The verb must agree with the singular subject, so **""continues""** (singular) is correct.  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""continues""** to match the singular noun ""production.""  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""continue""** (plural), which clashes with the singular subject.  

The phrase *""of many variants in different calibers""* is a prepositional phrase modifying ""production"" and does not affect subject-verb agreement."
15,continues,continue,2,The model 92 was designed in 1972 and production of many variants in different calibers continues today.,The model 92 was designed in 1972 and production of many variants in different calibers continue today.,17,4448,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Let me read them again carefully.

Sentence A: ""The model 92 was designed in 1972 and production of many variants in different calibers continue today.""

Sentence B: ""The model 92 was designed in 1972 and production of many variants in different calibers continues today.""

Hmm, the difference between them is the verb at the end: ""continue"" vs. ""continues"". So, the main thing here is subject-verb agreement. Let's break it down.

First, both sentences start with ""The model 92 was designed in 1972"" – that's past tense, correct. Then they both have ""and"" connecting another clause. The next part is ""production of many variants in different calibers"" followed by the verb. So the subject of the second clause is ""production"", right? Let's check that.

In Sentence A, the verb is ""continue"", which is plural. In Sentence B, it's ""continues"", which is singular. The subject here is ""production"", which is a singular noun. So the verb should agree with the singular subject. Therefore, ""production... continues"" would be correct. So Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because it uses the plural verb ""continue"" with a singular subject ""production"".

Wait, but maybe someone might think that ""many variants"" is the subject? Let me check. The structure is ""production of many variants..."". Here, ""of many variants"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""production"". The subject is still ""production"", which is singular. So the verb should be ""continues"". 

Another way to test: If we simplify the sentence, ""Production continues today."" That's correct. If we said ""Production continue today,"" that's wrong. So yes, Sentence B is correct. Therefore, Sentence A is incorrect because of the subject-verb agreement error.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the second clause is *""production""* (singular), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses *""continue""* (plural) with the singular subject *""production.""*  
- Sentence B correctly uses *""continues""* (singular) to match *""production.""*  

**Key Issue:**  
The error in Sentence A is a **subject-verb agreement** problem. The phrase *""of many variants""* is a prepositional phrase modifying *""production""* and does not affect the verb's number."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are a bit confusing, but I need to break them down step by step.

First, I'll look at the subject-verb agreement. In Sentence A, the subject is ""The students,"" which is plural. The verb used is ""are,"" which is correct for a plural subject. In Sentence B, the same subject ""The students"" is paired with ""is,"" which is singular. That immediately stands out as a problem. So Sentence B has a subject-verb agreement error.

Next, I'll check the rest of the sentences for other issues. Both sentences mention ""passers of philippine science high school."" The word ""philippine"" should be capitalized as it's part of the proper noun ""Philippine Science High School."" Also, ""passers"" might not be the best word here. Maybe ""passers"" refers to those who passed an exam, but ""passers"" isn't commonly used in this context. Perhaps ""successful candidates"" or ""those who passed"" would be clearer. However, since both sentences use ""passers,"" that's a shared issue but doesn't affect the grammaticality comparison between A and B.

The phrase ""including first screening passers"" is a bit awkward. It might be better to say ""including those who passed the first screening"" for clarity. But again, both sentences have this structure, so it's a shared problem.

Looking at the overall structure, Sentence A uses ""are"" correctly with ""students,"" while Sentence B incorrectly uses ""is."" That's the main difference. There's also a possible article issue. The sentence starts with ""The students in the school year 2008-2009..."" Maybe it should be ""during the school year"" instead of ""in,"" but that's a preposition choice rather than a grammatical error. The main issue is the subject-verb agreement.

So, the conclusion is that Sentence A is grammatical (though awkward), and Sentence B is ungrammatical due to the subject-verb disagreement. The user might also benefit from suggestions to improve clarity beyond just the grammatical aspects, but the question specifically asks about grammaticality.
</think>

**Analysis of the Sentences:**

1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - **Sentence A**: ""The students ... **are** actually passers...""  
     - **Correct**: The plural subject ""students"" matches the plural verb ""are.""  
   - **Sentence B**: ""The students ... **is** actually passers...""  
     - **Incorrect**: The plural subject ""students"" incorrectly pairs with the singular verb ""is.""  

2. **Other Issues**:  
   - Both sentences have awkward phrasing (e.g., ""passers of philippine science high school"" should capitalize ""Philippine Science High School"" and use clearer phrasing like ""successful candidates"").  
   - The phrase ""including first screening passers"" is grammatically correct but stylistically clunky.  

**Conclusion**:  
- **Grammatical**: **Sentence A** (despite stylistic flaws).  
- **Ungrammatical**: **Sentence B** (due to subject-verb disagreement).  

**Suggested Revision**:

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject in both sentences is ""The students in the school year 2008-2009."" The word ""students"" is plural, so the verb should agree with that. ""Students are"" is correct, whereas ""students is"" would be incorrect. So right away, Sentence B uses ""are,"" which matches the plural subject.

Looking at Sentence A, ""is"" is singular, which doesn't match ""students."" That makes Sentence A ungrammatical. But maybe there's more to check. Let me read the rest of the sentences to see if there are other issues. 

The phrase ""passers of philippine science high school"" – here, ""Philippine Science High School"" should be capitalized since it's a proper noun. Both sentences have it lowercase, so that's an error in both. But the user is asking about the grammaticality between A and B, so maybe that's a separate issue. 

The part ""including first screening passers"" is a bit awkward. It's a participial phrase modifying the main clause. It might be better to rephrase it for clarity, like ""including those who passed the first screening."" But again, both sentences have this structure, so it's not a differentiator between A and B. 

Another thing to check: ""actually passers of..."" – the word ""passers"" is correct here, but ""passers of"" might not be the most natural phrasing. Maybe ""passers in"" or ""passers from"" would be better. However, both sentences use ""of,"" so that's the same in both. 

So the main difference is the verb agreement. Since the subject is plural, ""are"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is not. 

Wait, let me double-check. The subject is ""The students..."", which is definitely plural. So ""are"" is correct. Yes, that's right. Sentence A uses ""is,"" which is wrong. So the answer is that Sentence B is grammatical, and A is ungrammatical due to subject-verb disagreement. 

Also, even though both sentences have other issues like capitalization and awkward phrasing, the key point here is the verb agreement. The user is specifically asking which is grammatical, so even if both have other errors, the main one that makes a sentence ungrammatical is the verb. So Sentence B is correct in terms of subject-verb agreement, making it the grammatical one.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Key Explanation:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - The subject of the sentence is **""The students""** (plural).  
   - Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb **""is""** (*""The students ... is""*), which violates subject-verb agreement.  
   - Sentence B correctly uses the plural verb **""are""** (*""The students ... are""*), matching the plural subject.  

2. **Other Issues**:  
   Both sentences have additional grammatical and stylistic problems (e.g., capitalization of *""Philippine Science High School""*, awkward phrasing like *""including first screening passers""*). However, the **critical error** in Sentence A is the subject-verb disagreement, which makes it ungrammatical.  

**Conclusion**: Sentence B is grammatically correct, while Sentence A is not."

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Both look almost the same except for the verb: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic idea is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. Let's break down the sentences.

The subject in both sentences is ""A few examples of his color work."" The main noun here is ""examples,"" which is plural. The phrase ""of his color work"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""examples."" So, the subject is plural because ""examples"" is plural. 

Now, the verb in Sentence A is ""are,"" which is plural. Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is singular. Since the subject is plural, the verb should also be plural. That would make Sentence A correct and Sentence B incorrect. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come between the subject and the verb. Like, if the subject was ""a few examples,"" but sometimes the prepositional phrase can trick you into thinking the verb should agree with ""work"" instead of ""examples."" But ""work"" here is part of the prepositional phrase, so it doesn't affect the verb. The verb has to agree with ""examples,"" which is plural. So ""are"" is correct. 

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. Take out the extra details: ""A few examples are available"" vs. ""A few examples is available."" The second one sounds wrong. Definitely, ""are"" is right. So Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is not. 

Also, looking at the rest of the sentences, the capitalization in ""center for creative photography"" and ""university of arizona"" might be an issue, but the user is specifically asking about the verb agreement. So even if there are other capitalization errors, the main point here is the subject-verb agreement. 

So, conclusion: Sentence A is correct because ""a few examples"" (plural) takes ""are."" Sentence B is incorrect because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Explanation:  
The key difference lies in **subject-verb agreement**:  
- The subject of the sentence is **""a few examples""** (plural).  
- The verb must agree with the plural subject: **""are""** (plural) is correct, while **""is""** (singular) is incorrect.  

**Why Sentence B is wrong:**  
The verb **""is""** incorrectly pairs with the plural subject **""a few examples""**, violating grammatical agreement.  

**Note:** Both sentences also have **capitalization errors** (e.g., ""center for creative photography"" and ""university of arizona"" should use uppercase letters for proper nouns). However, the primary issue here is the verb agreement.  

**Corrected Sentence A (with capitalization fixes):**  
*A few examples of his color work are available in the online archive of the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona.*"
7,are,is,2,A few examples of his color work are available in the online archive of the center for creative photography at the university of arizona.,A few examples of his color work is available in the online archive of the center for creative photography at the university of arizona.,24,4805,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Both look very similar except for the verb: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of each sentence. The main clause in both is about ""a few examples... is/are available."" The subject here is ""a few examples."" Now, ""a few examples"" is a plural noun phrase because ""a few"" is used with countable nouns and implies more than one. So, the verb should agree with a plural subject. That would mean ""are"" is correct, making Sentence B grammatical. 

But wait, sometimes people get confused with phrases that come after the subject. The sentence structure is ""A few examples (of his color work) are available..."" The part in parentheses is a prepositional phrase modifying ""examples,"" but the subject is still ""examples,"" which is plural. So the verb should be plural ""are,"" not singular ""is."" 

Sentence A uses ""is,"" which is singular, so that's incorrect. The error is subject-verb agreement. Even though ""work"" in the prepositional phrase is singular, it doesn't affect the verb. The verb must agree with the subject ""examples,"" not the object of the preposition. 

Let me double-check. If the subject were ""work,"" then ""is"" would be correct, but here the subject is ""examples."" So yes, Sentence B is correct. 

Another way to test is to simplify the sentence: ""A few examples are available."" That sounds right. If I said ""A few examples is available,"" that's clearly wrong. So definitely, Sentence B is grammatical, and A is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The subject of the sentence is **""a few examples""**, which is plural. The verb must agree with the plural subject, so **""are""** (plural) is correct.  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular), which clashes with the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses **""are""** (plural), matching the subject **""a few examples""**.  

The prepositional phrase **""of his color work""** does not affect the verb agreement. The key is to identify the true subject (**""examples""**) and ensure the verb matches its number.  

**Correct Sentence:**  
*A few examples of his color work **are** available in the online archive of the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona.*  

*(Note: Proper nouns like ""Center for Creative Photography"" and ""University of Arizona"" should also be capitalized.)*"
10,have,has,2,"Many pro users who come to the talk page, have their text hidden or deleted.","Many pro users who come to the talk page, has their text hidden or deleted.",15,5042,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are about pro users having their text hidden or deleted. 

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used: Sentence A uses ""have"" and Sentence B uses ""has"". So the key here is subject-verb agreement.

Let me break down Sentence A: ""Many pro users who come to the talk page, have their text hidden or deleted."" The subject here is ""Many pro users"". The phrase ""who come to the talk page"" is a relative clause modifying ""pro users"". The main verb is ""have"". 

Now, ""many pro users"" is a plural subject because ""many"" indicates more than one. The verb should agree with a plural subject, so ""have"" is correct. 

Looking at Sentence B: ""Many pro users who come to the talk page, has their text hidden or deleted."" Here, the verb is ""has"", which is singular. But the subject is still plural (""many pro users""), so ""has"" doesn't agree. That makes Sentence B incorrect.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with relative clauses. Let me check if the relative clause affects the subject. The relative clause ""who come to the talk page"" is describing ""pro users"", but the main clause's subject remains ""Many pro users"". The verb in the main clause should still agree with the plural subject. So ""have"" is correct, ""has"" is wrong.

Another thing to check: the comma after ""talk page"" in both sentences. Maybe that's a distraction. The comma might be incorrectly placed, but the user is focusing on the verb agreement. Even if the comma is an issue, the main problem here is the verb. So Sentence B is ungrammatical because of ""has"", and Sentence A is correct with ""have"".
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The subject of the main clause is ""Many pro users"" (plural). The verb must agree with this plural subject.  
  - Sentence A correctly uses **""have""** (plural verb).  
  - Sentence B incorrectly uses **""has""** (singular verb), which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Note:** Both sentences include an unnecessary comma after ""talk page,"" but this does not affect the core grammaticality of the verb choice. The critical error in Sentence B is the singular verb ""has"" paired with a plural subject."
10,have,has,2,"Many pro users who come to the talk page, have their text hidden or deleted.","Many pro users who come to the talk page, has their text hidden or deleted.",15,5042,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are about pro users having their text hidden or deleted. The difference between them is the verb ""has"" in Sentence A and ""have"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, the key here is to identify the subject of each sentence and determine if it's singular or plural.

Looking at Sentence A: ""Many pro users who come to the talk page, has their text hidden or deleted."" The main clause here is ""Many pro users ... has their text hidden or deleted."" The subject of the main clause is ""Many pro users."" ""Many"" indicates a plural noun, so the subject is plural. Therefore, the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Has"" is the third person singular form of ""to have,"" so using ""has"" with a plural subject would be incorrect. That suggests Sentence A is ungrammatical.

Sentence B: ""Many pro users who come to the talk page, have their text hidden or deleted."" Here, the main verb is ""have,"" which is the plural form. Since the subject ""Many pro users"" is plural, ""have"" should be correct. So Sentence B should be grammatical.

Wait, but let me check if there's a relative clause that might confuse the subject. The relative clause is ""who come to the talk page."" The subject of the relative clause is ""who,"" referring back to ""pro users,"" which is plural. So ""come"" is correctly plural. The main verb is still ""has"" or ""have,"" depending on the sentence. The main subject is still ""Many pro users,"" so the verb in the main clause must agree with that. Therefore, ""have"" is correct. 

Another thing to consider is the comma after ""talk page."" The sentence structure might be a bit off. If there's a comma, does that make the subject different? For example, sometimes commas can set off introductory phrases, but in this case, the structure is ""Many pro users [relative clause], have/has their text..."" The comma here might be incorrectly placed, but the user is focusing on the verb agreement. Even if the comma is an issue, the main point is the verb. So regardless of the comma, the verb should agree with ""Many pro users,"" which is plural. Therefore, Sentence B is correct, and A is incorrect.

So the conclusion is that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""Many pro users,"" which is plural. The verb must agree with the plural subject, so ""have"" (plural) is correct in Sentence B. Sentence A incorrectly uses ""has"" (singular), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Sentence A:** ""has"" (singular verb) does not match the plural subject ""Many pro users.""  
- **Sentence B:** ""have"" (plural verb) correctly agrees with the plural subject.  

**Note:** Both sentences contain a comma splice (unnecessary comma after ""talk page""), but the primary grammatical error in Sentence A is the verb form."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are similar except for the verb used: ""have"" in Sentence A and ""has"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""All the outstanding men and woman in the current world."" Let's break that down. ""All"" can be tricky because it depends on whether it's referring to a singular or plural noun. In this case, ""men and woman"" are plural, even though ""woman"" is singular. Wait, hold on. ""Men"" is plural, but ""woman"" is singular. So the subject is ""men and woman,"" which is plural because ""men"" is plural. Even though ""woman"" is singular, when combined with ""men,"" the whole subject becomes plural. So the verb should agree with a plural subject.

So the correct verb should be ""have"" (plural) instead of ""has"" (singular). That would make Sentence A correct and Sentence B incorrect. 

But wait, let me double-check. The subject is ""All the outstanding men and woman..."" ""All"" here is a determiner for the nouns ""men and woman."" Since ""men"" is plural and ""woman"" is singular, but they are connected by ""and,"" the total becomes plural. So the verb should be plural. Therefore, ""have"" is correct. So Sentence A is grammatical, and B is not.

Additionally, there are some spelling errors in both sentences. ""Succeses"" should be ""successes,"" and ""acedemics"" should be ""academics."" But the user is only asking about grammaticality, not spelling. So even with the spelling mistakes, the subject-verb agreement is the main issue here.

Another thing to check: ""woman"" in both sentences. Since ""men"" is plural, ""woman"" should be plural as well to match. So it should be ""women."" But the user's sentences have ""men and woman,"" which is inconsistent. However, that's a noun number agreement issue, not directly related to the verb agreement. The main issue here is the verb. So even if ""woman"" is singular, the subject is still plural because of ""men and..."" So the verb should still be plural. 

So, to sum up: Sentence A uses ""have,"" which is correct for a plural subject. Sentence B uses ""has,"" which is singular and incorrect. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Explanation:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - The subject of both sentences is *""All the outstanding men and woman in the current world""*.  
   - The phrase *""men and woman""* is plural (even though *""woman""* is singular, *""men""* is plural, and combined with *""and""*, the subject becomes plural).  
   - The verb must agree with a plural subject.  
     - ✅ **Sentence A** uses **""have""** (plural verb), which is correct.  
     - ❌ **Sentence B** uses **""has""** (singular verb), which is incorrect.  

2. **Other Errors (Noted but Not Asked About)**:  
   - Both sentences contain spelling mistakes:  
     - *""succeses""* → **""successes""**  
     - *""acedemics""* → **""academics""**  
   - *""woman""* should be pluralized to **""women""** to match *""men""*.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The critical grammatical error in Sentence B is the mismatch between the plural subject (*men and woman*) and the singular verb (*has*). Sentence A correctly uses the plural verb *""have""*."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb: ""has"" in A and ""have"" in B.

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject of both sentences is ""All the outstanding men and woman in the current world."" Wait, ""men and woman"" – that's plural, right? ""Men"" is plural, but ""woman"" is singular. Hmm, that might be a mistake. Shouldn't it be ""women"" to match the plural ""men""? But maybe that's a typo. Let's note that, but focus on the verb first.

The subject starts with ""All,"" which usually takes a plural verb. ""All"" can be singular or plural depending on context. Here, ""all"" refers to ""men and woman,"" which is plural (even if ""woman"" is singular, the conjunction makes it plural). So the verb should be plural. Sentence A uses ""has,"" which is singular, and B uses ""have,"" which is plural. So B should be correct here.

But wait, let's double-check. If the subject is ""All the outstanding men and woman,"" even if ""woman"" is singular, the conjunction ""and"" makes the subject plural. So plural verb ""have"" is needed. Therefore, sentence B is correct. Sentence A is incorrect because ""has"" is singular.

Also, looking at other parts: ""succeses"" is misspelled; it should be ""successes."" ""Acedemics"" is also misspelled; it should be ""academics."" But the user is asking about grammaticality, which mainly concerns structure, not spelling. However, sometimes spelling errors can affect grammaticality if they change the part of speech. Here, ""acedemics"" is a noun, just misspelled, so the structure is still okay. The main issue is subject-verb agreement.

So, conclusion: Sentence B is grammatical, Sentence A is not. The key error in A is using ""has"" instead of ""have"" to agree with the plural subject.

**Analysis of the Sentences:**

1. **Subject-Verb Agreement:**  
   - The subject of both sentences is *""All the outstanding men and woman...""*.  
   - **""Men and woman""** is plural (though ""woman"" should be pluralized as **""women""** for consistency).  
   - The verb must agree with the plural subject.  
     - **Sentence A** uses **""has""** (singular), which is incorrect.  
     - **Sentence B** uses **""have""** (plural), which is correct.  

2. **Spelling Errors (Noted but Not Critical for Grammaticality):**  
   - **""succeses""** → **""successes""**  
   - **""acedemics""** → **""academics""**  

**Conclusion:**  
- **Sentence B** is **grammatical** (correct subject-verb agreement).  
- **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical** (incorrect verb ""has"").  

**Key Fixes for Full Correctness:**  
- Use **""women""** instead of ""woman"" for plural consistency.  
- Correct spelling of **""successes""** and **""academics""**.

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence to determine subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""The specifics of the geology of the canyon."" The head noun here is ""specifics,"" which is plural. So, the verb should agree with a plural subject. That would mean ""are"" is correct.

But wait, sometimes even if the head noun is plural, if the entire phrase is considered a singular concept, the verb might be singular. For example, ""The specifics are..."" versus ""The study of specifics is..."" Hmm. In this case, ""specifics"" refers to multiple specific details, so it's definitely plural. Therefore, ""are"" is the right choice. So Sentence A uses ""are"" and is correct, while Sentence B uses ""is"" and is incorrect.

Let me double-check. The structure is ""The specifics... are not well understood."" Yes, because ""specifics"" is the subject, and it's plural. The rest of the sentence, ""of the geology of the canyon,"" is just prepositional phrases modifying ""specifics."" So the verb must agree with ""specifics,"" which is plural. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical due to the incorrect verb form.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""The specifics""* (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject *""specifics.""*  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), which clashes with the plural subject.  

The error in Sentence B violates **subject-verb agreement**, a core grammatical rule. The rest of the sentence structure is identical and correct in both versions."
8,are,is,2,"The specifics of the geology of the canyon are not well understood, except that it is an erosional feature rather than the result of glaciation.","The specifics of the geology of the canyon is not well understood, except that it is an erosional feature rather than the result of glaciation.",25,5628,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about the specifics of the geology of the canyon. The main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The subject here is ""The specifics of the geology of the canyon."" The key word here is ""specifics."" Now, ""specifics"" is a plural noun, right? It refers to the detailed aspects or particulars. So, the subject is plural. 

In English, the verb must agree with the subject in number. If the subject is singular, the verb should be singular; if plural, the verb should be plural. So, since ""specifics"" is plural, the verb should be ""are"" instead of ""is."" That would make Sentence B correct because it uses ""are,"" and Sentence A incorrect with ""is.""

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come after the subject. For example, in sentences like ""The list of items is long,"" the subject is ""list,"" which is singular, so the verb is ""is."" But in this case, the subject is ""specifics,"" not ""geology"" or ""canyon."" The prepositional phrases ""of the geology of the canyon"" are just modifiers describing the specifics. So the main noun is still ""specifics,"" which is plural.

Therefore, Sentence B is correct because it uses the plural verb ""are"" to agree with the plural subject ""specifics."" Sentence A uses ""is,"" which is singular, so it's incorrect. 

Another thing to check is the rest of the sentence. The part after the comma says ""except that it is an erosional feature..."" Here, ""it"" refers back to the canyon's geology or the canyon itself, which is singular. That part is okay because ""it"" is correctly referring to a singular noun. So that doesn't affect the subject-verb agreement in the main clause.

So, conclusion: Sentence B is grammatical, Sentence A is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""The specifics of the geology of the canyon""*. The core noun here is **""specifics""**, which is plural. Therefore, the verb must agree in number with the plural subject, requiring **""are""** (as in Sentence B).  

Sentence A incorrectly uses **""is""**, which is singular and does not match the plural subject. The rest of the sentence (after the comma) is grammatically sound in both cases, as *""it""* appropriately refers to the singular *""geology of the canyon""*.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Subject-verb agreement hinges on identifying the core noun in the subject phrase. Here, **""specifics""** (plural) dictates the plural verb **""are""**."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both starting the same way but differing in the verb: ""is"" vs. ""are"". 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The main clause in both sentences is ""the focus ... is/are the main conceptual difference"". The subject here is ""the focus on the dynamics of the studied systems"". Even though ""systems"" is plural, the subject is actually ""focus"", which is singular. So the verb should agree with ""focus"", not ""dynamics"" or ""systems"". 

In sentence A, the verb is ""is"", which is singular. That matches the singular subject ""focus"". In sentence B, the verb is ""are"", which is plural. That doesn't agree with the singular subject. Therefore, sentence A should be correct, and B incorrect.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come after the subject. For example, if the subject were ""dynamics"", which is plural, then ""are"" would be correct. But here, the subject is ""focus"", so the verb must be singular. The prepositional phrases ""on the dynamics"" and ""of the studied systems"" are just modifiers describing the focus. They don't change the subject's number.

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. Remove the modifiers: ""The focus is the main difference."" That's correct. If we used ""are"", it would be ""The focus are the main difference,"" which is clearly wrong. So sentence A is correct, B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""the focus""** (singular), not ""the dynamics"" or ""systems"" (plural). The verb must agree with the singular subject ""focus,"" so the correct form is **""is""** (singular) rather than **""are""** (plural).  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""is""** to match the singular subject.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""are""**, which creates a subject-verb disagreement.  

**Tip:** Ignore prepositional phrases like *""on the dynamics of the studied systems""* when determining subject-verb agreement. The core subject (""focus"") dictates the verb form."
11,is,are,2,"Indeed, the focus on the dynamics of the studied systems is the main conceptual difference between systems biology and bioinformatics.","Indeed, the focus on the dynamics of the studied systems are the main conceptual difference between systems biology and bioinformatics.",20,6157,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. Both sentences are very similar, except for the verb used: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B. The subject of the sentence is ""the focus on the dynamics of the studied systems."" 

First, I need to determine the subject-verb agreement here. The main subject is ""the focus,"" which is singular. The verb should agree with the subject in number. So, if the subject is singular, the verb should be singular as well. 

Looking at Sentence A: ""the focus... are the main conceptual difference."" Since ""focus"" is singular, using ""are"" (plural) doesn't agree. That would make Sentence A incorrect.

Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is singular, matching the singular subject ""focus."" Therefore, Sentence B should be correct. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come after the subject. For example, if there's a prepositional phrase like ""on the dynamics..."" which includes a plural noun ""dynamics,"" but the actual subject is still ""focus."" So, the verb should still agree with ""focus,"" not the object of the preposition. 

So, even though ""dynamics"" is plural, it's part of the prepositional phrase modifying ""focus."" The main subject remains ""focus,"" so the verb should be ""is."" Therefore, Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect because it mistakenly uses ""are"" due to the proximity to the plural noun ""systems"" or ""dynamics.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""the focus on the dynamics of the studied systems""*, which is singular (the core noun is *""focus""*). The verb must agree with this singular subject, so the correct form is **""is""** (Sentence B).  

Sentence A incorrectly uses **""are""**, which is plural, creating a subject-verb disagreement. The plural noun *""systems""* in the prepositional phrase (*""of the studied systems""*) might mislead some writers, but it does not affect the grammatical number of the subject.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Always identify the core subject (here, *""focus""*) and ensure the verb matches its singular/plural form, ignoring intervening phrases."
7,include,includes,2,"Other scholars serving on the editorial board include touraj atabaki, sally cummings, bhavna dave, and olivier roy, among others.","Other scholars serving on the editorial board includes touraj atabaki, sally cummings, bhavna dave, and olivier roy, among others.",19,6287,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb: ""include"" in Sentence A and ""includes"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The subject here is ""Other scholars serving on the editorial board."" The verb needs to agree with this subject in number. Let's break it down.

""Other scholars"" is a plural noun phrase. The phrase ""serving on the editorial board"" is a participial phrase modifying ""scholars."" So the entire subject is ""Other scholars [who are] serving on the editorial board,"" which is still plural. 

Now, the verb that follows should agree with a plural subject. ""Include"" is the plural form, while ""includes"" is singular. So Sentence A uses ""include,"" which is correct for a plural subject. Sentence B uses ""includes,"" which would be incorrect here because the subject is plural. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with collective nouns or when the subject is separated by phrases. Let me double-check. The structure is ""Other scholars... include..."" The verb comes after the subject, but in this case, the subject is definitely plural. So ""include"" is correct. 

Another way to test is to simplify the sentence. Remove the participial phrase: ""Other scholars include..."" That's clearly correct. If it were a singular subject, like ""A scholar includes,"" that would be wrong. But here, plural ""scholars"" need ""include."" 

So Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is not because of the subject-verb agreement error. The user might be confused because sometimes when the verb comes after a list, people make mistakes, but in this case, the verb is before the list. The list is the object of the verb, not the subject. The subject is still ""scholars,"" so the verb must agree with that. 

I should also check if there's any other possible issues. Capitalization of the names? The original sentences have them lowercase, which is incorrect, but the user is only asking about grammaticality regarding the verb. So the main issue is ""include"" vs. ""includes."" 

Yes, so the conclusion is Sentence A is correct, Sentence B is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Other scholars serving on the editorial board""**, which is plural. The verb must agree with the plural subject, so the correct form is **""include""** (plural) rather than **""includes""** (singular).  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""include""** to match the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""includes""**, which violates subject-verb agreement.  

**Note:** Proper nouns like *Touraj Atabaki*, *Sally Cummings*, etc., should be capitalized in formal writing, but this was not the focus of the grammaticality question here."
7,include,includes,2,"Other scholars serving on the editorial board include touraj atabaki, sally cummings, bhavna dave, and olivier roy, among others.","Other scholars serving on the editorial board includes touraj atabaki, sally cummings, bhavna dave, and olivier roy, among others.",19,6287,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about scholars on an editorial board. The main difference between them is the verb: ""includes"" in sentence A and ""include"" in sentence B.

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""Other scholars serving on the editorial board."" Let me break that down. The main noun is ""scholars,"" which is plural. The phrase ""serving on the editorial board"" is a participial phrase modifying ""scholars."" So the subject is plural because ""scholars"" is plural. 

Now, the verb in sentence A is ""includes,"" which is singular. That's a problem because a plural subject should take a plural verb. The correct verb form for plural subjects is ""include,"" which is in sentence B. So sentence B should be correct, and sentence A incorrect because of the mismatch in number.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with collective nouns or when the subject is separated from the verb by other phrases. Let me double-check. The subject is definitely ""scholars,"" which is plural. The verb comes after the subject, so even though there's a list of names after the verb, the verb should agree with the subject, not the list. The list is the object of the verb, not part of the subject. So ""scholars... include"" is correct. 

Another thing to check: sometimes ""include"" vs. ""includes"" can be tricky if the subject is a singular noun followed by a plural complement. But in this case, the subject is clearly plural. So sentence B is correct. Sentence A uses ""includes,"" which is singular, so it's incorrect. 

Also, proper nouns like names should be capitalized. The names in both sentences are lowercase, which is a separate issue, but the question is about grammaticality, which probably refers to syntax rather than capitalization. So even though the names aren't capitalized, the main issue is subject-verb agreement. 

So the conclusion is that sentence B is grammatical because ""include"" agrees with the plural subject ""scholars,"" while sentence A is ungrammatical due to using the singular ""includes"" with a plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is ""Other scholars serving on the editorial board,"" where the core noun (""scholars"") is plural.  
- The verb must agree in number with the subject. A plural subject requires a plural verb (""include""), not a singular verb (""includes"").  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses ""includes"" (singular) with the plural subject, violating subject-verb agreement.  
- Sentence B correctly uses ""include"" (plural), making it grammatically sound.  

**Note:** Both sentences have capitalization errors (e.g., proper nouns like ""Touraj Atabaki"" should be capitalized), but the question focuses on grammaticality, not punctuation or style."
5,are,is,2,"Environmental studies and design work are underway, and construction on the i-69 portion of the project was expected to begin in 2012.","Environmental studies and design work is underway, and construction on the i-69 portion of the project was expected to begin in 2012.",22,6444,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about environmental studies, design work, and construction. The main difference between them is the verb used with ""Environmental studies and design work""—""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is a compound subject: ""Environmental studies and design work."" When you have two subjects connected by ""and,"" they usually form a plural subject, so the verb should be plural. That would mean ""are"" is correct. So Sentence A uses ""are,"" which should be right, and Sentence B uses ""is,"" which might be wrong.

But wait, sometimes when two subjects connected by ""and"" refer to a single thing, they can take a singular verb. For example, ""Peanut butter and jelly is my favorite sandwich."" But in this case, ""Environmental studies"" and ""design work"" are two separate activities. They aren't a single entity. So they should take a plural verb. Therefore, ""are"" in Sentence A is correct, making Sentence B incorrect.

Looking at the rest of the sentences, both use ""was expected,"" which is past tense. That seems okay because the expected start in 2012 is in the past. So the main issue is the subject-verb agreement in the first part.

So, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because it uses ""is"" with a plural compound subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - The subject ""Environmental studies and design work"" is a **compound subject** (two distinct activities). When joined by ""and,"" compound subjects typically require a **plural verb** (""are"").  
   - Sentence A correctly uses **""are""** to agree with the plural subject.  
   - Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), which does not match the plural subject.  

2. **Context Clue**:  
   The phrase ""environmental studies and design work"" refers to two separate ongoing processes, not a single unified concept. This reinforces the need for a plural verb.  

3. **Secondary Clause**:  
   Both sentences correctly use **""was expected""** (past tense) for the second clause, as the expectation about the 2012 construction start is in the past.  

**Conclusion**: Sentence A follows standard grammar rules, while Sentence B violates subject-verb agreement."
5,are,is,2,"Environmental studies and design work are underway, and construction on the i-69 portion of the project was expected to begin in 2012.","Environmental studies and design work is underway, and construction on the i-69 portion of the project was expected to begin in 2012.",22,6444,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, and the difference between them is the verb used with ""Environmental studies and design work""—""is"" in A and ""are"" in B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. Here, the subject is ""Environmental studies and design work."" Since there are two things here—studies and work—connected by ""and,"" that usually makes the subject plural. So the verb should be plural as well. That would mean ""are"" is correct, making sentence B grammatical. 

But wait, sometimes when two subjects are joined by ""and,"" they might be considered a single concept, which would take a singular verb. For example, ""peanut butter and jelly is my favorite sandwich."" But in this case, ""environmental studies"" and ""design work"" seem like two separate activities. They're both parts of the project, but they're distinct. So they should be treated as a plural subject. 

Another thing to check: ""work"" can sometimes be tricky. ""Work"" is usually uncountable, so it's singular. But here it's ""design work,"" which is still singular. However, when combined with ""environmental studies,"" which is plural, the whole subject becomes plural. So ""are"" is correct. 

Looking at the sentences again: Sentence A uses ""is,"" which would be incorrect because the subject is plural. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is correct. Therefore, sentence B is grammatical, and sentence A is ungrammatical. 

I should also check the rest of the sentences for any other issues. The second part of both sentences says ""construction... was expected to begin in 2012."" The tense here is past tense (""was expected""), which makes sense if they're talking about a past expectation. The verb ""was"" agrees with ""construction,"" which is singular. So that part is correct in both sentences. 

So the main issue is the subject-verb agreement in the first part. Since the subject is plural, ""are"" is needed. Therefore, sentence B is correct, and sentence A is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject ""Environmental studies and design work"" is plural (two distinct activities), so it requires the plural verb **""are""** (not ""is""). Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb ""is,"" violating subject-verb agreement.  

**Key Details:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement:** When two or more nouns are joined by ""and,"" they typically form a plural subject requiring a plural verb (e.g., ""studies and work **are**"").  
- **Exception Note:** If the nouns form a single unified concept (e.g., ""peanut butter and jelly""), a singular verb may apply. However, ""environmental studies and design work"" are separate activities, so the plural verb is required.  
- **Second Clause:** Both sentences correctly use ""was expected"" (past tense) for the singular noun ""construction,"" so no issue there.  

**Conclusion:**  
Sentence B is correct; Sentence A is not."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about concentrations in surface water and their sufficiency for assessing risk. 

First, I need to compare the two sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used: Sentence A uses ""are not sufficient,"" while Sentence B uses ""is not sufficient."" So the key here is subject-verb agreement.

The subject of both sentences is ""Concentrations in surface water alone."" Let's break that down. The main noun here is ""Concentrations,"" which is plural. The prepositional phrases ""in surface water"" and ""alone"" are modifiers describing the concentrations. So the subject is plural because ""concentrations"" is plural. 

In English, the verb must agree with the subject in number. Since the subject is plural (""concentrations""), the verb should also be plural. ""Are"" is the plural form of the verb ""to be,"" while ""is"" is singular. 

Looking at Sentence A: ""Concentrations... are not sufficient."" That matches because plural subject with plural verb. Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is singular, so that would be incorrect. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come after the subject. For example, if the subject were ""surface water alone,"" then ""is"" would be correct. But here, the subject is definitely ""Concentrations,"" which is plural. The phrase ""in surface water alone"" is just giving more information about where the concentrations are. 

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. Remove the modifiers: ""Concentrations are not sufficient..."" vs. ""Concentrations is not sufficient..."" The second one clearly sounds wrong. 

So Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect because of the subject-verb disagreement. The user might be testing understanding of subject-verb agreement, especially with intervening phrases. It's a common mistake to misidentify the subject when there are prepositional phrases in between. 

I should also consider if there's any exception or special case here. For instance, sometimes collective nouns can be tricky, but ""concentrations"" is a straightforward plural noun. No exceptions apply here. 

Therefore, the answer is that Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical due to the incorrect verb form ""is"" instead of ""are.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Concentrations""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number. Sentence A correctly uses the plural verb **""are""**, while Sentence B incorrectly uses the singular verb **""is""**. The intervening prepositional phrase *""in surface water alone""* does not affect the grammatical number of the subject.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-verb agreement**: Plural subject (*concentrations*) requires a plural verb (*are*).  
- Sentence B violates this rule by pairing a plural subject with a singular verb (*is*)."

First, I need to figure out the difference between them. Looking at the sentences, the main difference is the verb: Sentence A uses ""is"" and Sentence B uses ""are"". So the key here is subject-verb agreement.

The subject in both sentences is ""Concentrations in surface water alone"". Let's break that down. The main noun here is ""Concentrations"", which is plural. The prepositional phrases ""in surface water"" and ""alone"" are modifiers describing where the concentrations are. So the subject is plural because ""concentrations"" is plural. 

In English, the verb must agree with the subject in number. Since the subject is plural (""concentrations""), the verb should also be plural. ""Are"" is the plural form of the verb ""to be"" in the present tense, while ""is"" is singular. 

Therefore, Sentence A uses ""is"", which is singular, but the subject is plural. That makes Sentence A incorrect. Sentence B uses ""are"", which matches the plural subject, so it's correct. 

Wait, but sometimes there can be confusion with intervening phrases. For example, if the subject were singular but had a phrase that made it seem plural. But in this case, ""concentrations"" is definitely plural. The modifiers ""in surface water"" and ""alone"" don't change the number of the subject. 

Another thing to check: sometimes words like ""alone"" might be mistaken for part of the subject, but here ""alone"" is an adverb modifying the entire noun phrase. It doesn't affect the number. 

So yes, Sentence B is correct because ""are"" agrees with the plural subject ""concentrations"". Sentence A is incorrect because ""is"" doesn't agree.
</think>

The grammatical sentence is **Sentence B**, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical. Here's why:

### Key Issue: **Subject-Verb Agreement**
- **Subject**: ""Concentrations in surface water alone""  
  - The core noun is **""concentrations""** (plural).  
  - Phrases like ""in surface water"" and ""alone"" are modifiers and do not affect the grammatical number of the subject.  

- **Verb Choice**:  
  - **Sentence A** uses **""is""** (singular verb), which clashes with the plural subject.  
  - **Sentence B** uses **""are""** (plural verb), which correctly agrees with the plural subject.  

### Why Sentence B is Correct:
- **""Concentrations ... are not sufficient""** properly matches the plural subject with a plural verb.  

### Why Sentence A is Incorrect:
- **""Concentrations ... is not sufficient""** creates a mismatch between the plural subject and the singular verb.  

**Final Answer**:  
✅ **Sentence B** is grammatical.  
❌ **Sentence A** is ungrammatical."

Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. Both sentences are very similar, except for the verb after ""class of expressions."" Sentence A uses ""tends"" and Sentence B uses ""tend.""

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The main subject here is ""the class of expressions."" The verb in question is either ""tends"" or ""tend."" The key is to determine whether the subject is singular or plural.

The word ""class"" is a collective noun. Collective nouns can be tricky because they refer to a group but are singular in form. In American English, collective nouns are usually treated as singular, so the verb should agree with the singular noun. So, ""class"" is singular, so the verb should be ""tends."" That would make Sentence A correct.

But wait, sometimes when the noun after ""of"" is plural, people might get confused. The phrase is ""class of expressions."" Even though ""expressions"" is plural, the main subject is still ""class,"" which is singular. So the verb should still be singular: ""tends.""

Sentence B uses ""tend,"" which is plural. That would be incorrect because the subject is singular. So Sentence B is ungrammatical.

Let me double-check. If the sentence were ""The classes of expressions tend..."" then ""tend"" would be correct. But here it's ""class,"" so singular. Yes, I think that's right. So Sentence A is correct, Sentence B is wrong.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb is ""the class"" (singular), not ""expressions"" (plural). In English, collective nouns like ""class,"" ""group,"" or ""team"" typically take singular verbs, even when followed by a prepositional phrase with a plural noun (e.g., ""of expressions"").  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses the singular verb **""tends""** to agree with the singular subject ""class.""  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses the plural verb **""tend,""** which mistakenly agrees with the plural noun ""expressions"" instead of the singular subject ""class.""  

Thus, **Sentence A** is grammatically correct."

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. Both sentences are very similar, except for the verb ""tend"" vs. ""tends."" I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that subject-verb agreement is crucial here. The subject of the sentence is ""the class,"" which is singular. So, the verb should agree with a singular subject. Let me check the sentences again.

Sentence A uses ""tend,"" which is plural. Sentence B uses ""tends,"" which is singular. Since ""class"" is singular, ""tends"" should be correct. But wait, sometimes collective nouns can take a plural verb if the focus is on the members of the group. However, in American English, collective nouns are usually treated as singular. So ""the class... tends"" would be correct in American English. But in British English, sometimes they use plural verbs with collective nouns. Hmm, but the sentence is about the class as a single entity, so even in British English, maybe ""tends"" is better here.

Another thing to consider is the phrase between the subject and the verb. The subject is ""the class of expressions considered to be analytical expressions."" The core subject is ""class,"" which is singular. The prepositional phrase ""of expressions"" doesn't change the number of the subject. So the verb should still be singular: ""tends.""

Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because it uses a plural verb with a singular subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""the class of expressions""*. Here, **""class""** is a singular collective noun, so the verb must agree with it in number. The correct form is **""tends""** (singular), not **""tend""** (plural).  

The intervening phrase *""of expressions considered to be analytical expressions""* does not alter the grammatical number of the subject. Even though ""expressions"" is plural, the core subject remains **""class""** (singular).  

Thus, Sentence B correctly uses **""tends""**, while Sentence A incorrectly uses **""tend""**, violating subject-verb agreement."

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Let me read them again.

Sentence A: ""Sixth form students at the attached sixth form college have a much more relaxed dress code.""
Sentence B: ""Sixth form students at the attached sixth form college has a much more relaxed dress code.""

Hmm, the difference between them is the verb: ""have"" vs. ""has"". I need to figure out which one is correct. Let's break it down.

First, identify the subject of the sentence. The main clause is about the sixth form students. The subject is ""Sixth form students"". Then there's a prepositional phrase: ""at the attached sixth form college"". Prepositional phrases usually don't affect the verb agreement, so the main subject is still ""students"".

Now, ""students"" is plural, so the verb should agree with a plural subject. The verb in question is ""have"" or ""has"". ""Have"" is the plural form, and ""has"" is the singular. So, ""students have"" would be correct, and ""students has"" would be incorrect.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes people get confused with the subject when there's a prepositional phrase. For example, if the sentence was ""The college has..."", then ""has"" would be correct. But here, the subject is ""students"", not ""college"". The phrase ""at the attached sixth form college"" is just giving more information about where the students are, but it's not the subject.

So, Sentence A uses ""have"" which matches the plural subject ""students"", making it correct. Sentence B uses ""has"", which is singular, so it doesn't agree with the plural subject. Therefore, Sentence B is ungrammatical.

I should also consider if there's any other reason why ""has"" might be used. Maybe if the structure was different, like ""The college has students..."", but in this case, the structure is ""students... have..."". So no, ""has"" doesn't fit here. 

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. Remove the prepositional phrase: ""Sixth form students have a much more relaxed dress code."" That's clearly correct. If you use ""has"" there, it's wrong. So adding the prepositional phrase doesn't change the verb agreement. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""Sixth form students""** (plural). The verb must agree with the plural subject, so **""have""** (plural) is correct.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""has""** (singular), which does not match the plural subject. The prepositional phrase **""at the attached sixth form college""** does not affect subject-verb agreement.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Always identify the **true subject** of the sentence (ignoring prepositional phrases) to ensure proper verb agreement. Plural subjects require plural verbs (*have*), and singular subjects require singular verbs (*has*)."

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Let me read them again carefully.

Sentence A: ""Sixth form students at the attached sixth form college has a much more relaxed dress code.""
Sentence B: ""Sixth form students at the attached sixth form college have a much more relaxed dress code.""

Hmm, the main difference between them is the verb: ""has"" vs. ""have"". I need to figure out which one is correct. Let's break it down.

First, identify the subject of the sentence. The subject is the one performing the action or being described. In both sentences, the main subject seems to be ""Sixth form students"". The phrase ""at the attached sixth form college"" is a prepositional phrase that gives more information about where the students are, but it's not the subject. 

So, the core of the sentence is ""Sixth form students have/has a much more relaxed dress code."" Now, the verb needs to agree with the subject in number. ""Sixth form students"" is plural because it's referring to multiple students. Therefore, the verb should be plural as well. 

The verb ""have"" is the plural form, and ""has"" is the singular form. So, ""students have"" is correct, while ""students has"" is incorrect. That would make Sentence B correct and Sentence A incorrect. 

Wait, let me double-check. Sometimes prepositional phrases can be tricky. For example, if the subject was ""college,"" which is singular, then ""has"" would be correct. But in this case, the subject is ""students,"" not ""college."" The prepositional phrase ""at the attached sixth form college"" is modifying ""students,"" telling us which students we're talking about. So the verb still needs to agree with ""students,"" which is plural. 

Another way to test this is to simplify the sentence. Remove the prepositional phrase: ""Sixth form students have a much more relaxed dress code."" That's clearly correct. If the sentence were about the college, it would be structured differently, like ""The attached sixth form college has a much more relaxed dress code for its students."" But in the given sentences, the subject is definitely the students. 

So, yes, Sentence B is grammatical because the plural subject ""students"" matches the plural verb ""have."" Sentence A uses ""has,"" which is singular, so it doesn't agree with the plural subject, making it ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence B** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Sixth form students""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- **""Have""** (Sentence B) is correct because it is the plural form of the verb, matching the plural subject.  
- **""Has""** (Sentence A) is incorrect because it is singular, creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

**Key Tip:**  
Ignore prepositional phrases like *""at the attached sixth form college""* when determining subject-verb agreement. The core subject (**students**) dictates the verb form."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences start with ""Strong support sharp, colorful, encyclopedic, but..."" and then differ in the verb used: ""give"" in A and ""gives"" in B.

First, I need to check the structure of each sentence. The first part before ""but"" seems a bit fragmented. ""Strong support sharp, colorful, encyclopedic..."" That part might be missing a verb. Maybe it's supposed to be something like ""Strong support is sharp..."" but that's not there. However, the main difference is in the second part after ""but.""

Looking at the second part: ""the different textures at each level of the composition give/gives it an artistic quality as well."" The subject here is ""the different textures,"" which is plural. So the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Give"" is plural, and ""gives"" is singular. Therefore, ""give"" would be correct here. So sentence A uses ""give,"" which matches the plural subject, making it correct. Sentence B uses ""gives,"" which is singular and doesn't agree with the plural subject, so it's incorrect.

Wait, but maybe I should check if there's any other part of the sentence that could affect subject-verb agreement. The phrase ""at each level of the composition"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""textures."" The subject is still ""textures,"" so the verb should still be plural. Therefore, ""give"" is correct. So sentence A is grammatical, and B is ungrammatical because of the verb agreement error.

Also, the first part of the sentence might be a fragment. ""Strong support sharp..."" Maybe it's missing a verb like ""is"" or ""has,"" but since both sentences have the same structure there, the main issue is the verb in the second clause. So the key difference is ""give"" vs. ""gives,"" and since the subject is plural, ""give"" is correct. Therefore, sentence A is correct, B is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The key difference lies in the verb agreement in the second clause:  
- **Sentence A** uses **""give""**, which correctly agrees with the plural subject **""the different textures""**.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""gives""** (singular) with the plural subject **""textures""**, violating subject-verb agreement.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- The first part of both sentences (""Strong support sharp, colorful, encyclopedic..."") is a fragment and awkwardly phrased. However, since both sentences share this structure, the grammaticality hinges on the verb choice in the second clause.  
- To improve clarity, the first clause could be revised (e.g., *""The strong support is sharp, colorful, and encyclopedic...""*), but this does not affect the core grammatical distinction here."
18,give,gives,2,"Strong support sharp, colorful, encyclopedic, but the different textures at each level of the composition give it an artistic quality as well.","Strong support sharp, colorful, encyclopedic, but the different textures at each level of the composition gives it an artistic quality as well.",22,7244,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both starting with ""Strong support sharp, colorful, encyclopedic, but..."" and then differing in the verb ""gives"" vs. ""give"". 

First, I need to check the structure of each sentence. The first part before ""but"" seems a bit fragmented. ""Strong support sharp, colorful, encyclopedic"" – that part might be missing a verb or a conjunction. Maybe it's supposed to be something like ""The strong support is sharp, colorful, encyclopedic..."" but as it stands, it's a fragment. However, the main focus here is on the part after ""but"".

Looking at the subject after ""but"": ""the different textures at each level of the composition"". The verb here is either ""gives"" or ""give"". The subject is ""the different textures"", which is plural. So the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Give"" is plural, ""gives"" is singular. Therefore, ""give"" should be correct. So sentence B uses ""give"", which is correct, and sentence A uses ""gives"", which is incorrect because the subject is plural.

Wait, but maybe the user is being tricked by a complex subject. Let me double-check. The subject is ""the different textures at each level of the composition"". The head noun here is ""textures"", which is plural. The prepositional phrase ""at each level..."" modifies ""textures"" but doesn't change the number. So the verb should indeed be plural ""give"". Therefore, sentence B is correct, and A is incorrect.

But wait, sometimes people get confused with phrases like ""each level"", thinking it makes the subject singular. But in this case, ""each level"" is part of the prepositional phrase describing where the textures are, not the subject itself. The subject is still ""textures"", so plural. So yes, ""give"" is correct. 

So the answer should be that sentence B is grammatical, and A is ungrammatical because of subject-verb agreement. The first part of the sentence is a fragment, but the user is specifically pointing out the difference in the verbs, so that's the main issue here.
</think>

**Answer:**

- **Sentence B** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb in the second clause is *""the different textures at each level of the composition""*. The head noun here is *""textures""* (plural), so the verb must agree with a plural subject.  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses *""gives""* (singular), which clashes with the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses *""give""* (plural), matching the plural subject *""textures""*.  

**Note:** Both sentences have an **incomplete first clause** (*""Strong support sharp, colorful, encyclopedic...""* lacks a verb or conjunction), but the critical grammatical distinction lies in the subject-verb agreement after *""but""*."

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Let me read them again carefully.

Sentence A: ""People who suffer from profound hearing loss are very hard of hearing and they mostly rely on lip-reading and sign language.""

Sentence B: ""People who suffer from profound hearing loss is very hard of hearing and they mostly rely on lip-reading and sign language.""

Hmm, the main difference I notice is the verb used after ""profound hearing loss."" Sentence A uses ""are,"" while Sentence B uses ""is."" The subject here is ""People who suffer from profound hearing loss."" Let's break that down.

First, ""People"" is a plural noun. The relative clause ""who suffer from profound hearing loss"" is modifying ""People,"" so the entire subject is still plural. Therefore, the verb should agree in number. Since ""People"" is plural, the verb should be ""are"" instead of ""is."" 

In Sentence B, using ""is"" would be incorrect because ""is"" is singular. The subject is plural, so the verb must be plural as well. That makes Sentence A correct and Sentence B incorrect. 

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something else. The structure of the sentence is a compound predicate: ""are very hard of hearing"" and ""they mostly rely..."" In Sentence A, ""are"" is correctly used with the plural subject. In Sentence B, ""is"" doesn't agree with the plural subject. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes people might confuse the subject with a singular noun in the relative clause. For example, if the subject was ""A person who suffers...,"" then ""is"" would be correct. But here, it's ""People,"" so the verb must be plural. 

Yes, I think that's right. So Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb agreement error.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject ""People who suffer from profound hearing loss"" is **plural** (""People"" + plural verb ""suffer"").  
- In Sentence A, the plural verb **""are""** correctly agrees with the plural subject.  
- In Sentence B, the singular verb **""is""** incorrectly disagrees with the plural subject, making the sentence ungrammatical.  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement. Plural subjects require plural verbs."
7,are,is,3,People who suffer from profound hearing loss are very hard of hearing and they mostly rely on lip-reading and sign language.,People who suffer from profound hearing loss is very hard of hearing and they mostly rely on lip-reading and sign language.,21,389,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. 

First, I'll look at Sentence A: ""People who suffer from profound hearing loss is very hard of hearing and they mostly rely on lip-reading and sign language."" The main clause here is ""People ... is very hard of hearing."" The subject is ""People,"" which is plural. The verb here is ""is,"" which is singular. That's a problem because the subject and verb need to agree in number. So ""People is"" should be ""People are."" That makes me think Sentence A is incorrect.

Now, Sentence B: ""People who suffer from profound hearing loss are very hard of hearing and they mostly rely on lip-reading and sign language."" Here, the main clause is ""People ... are very hard of hearing."" The subject ""People"" is plural, and the verb ""are"" is plural. That matches, so subject-verb agreement is correct here. 

Another thing to check is the rest of the sentence structure. Both sentences use ""and they mostly rely..."" which is a separate clause. The conjunction ""and"" is correctly used to connect the two independent clauses. In Sentence A, even if the verb were correct, the rest of the sentence structure is okay. But the main issue is the subject-verb agreement in the first part.

So, the key difference is ""is"" vs. ""are."" Since ""People"" is plural, ""are"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  

**Sentence B** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement Error in Sentence A:**  
  The subject ""People"" (plural) does not agree with the singular verb ""is."" The correct plural verb form should be ""are.""  

- **Correct Structure in Sentence B:**  
  ""People ... **are** very hard of hearing"" correctly matches the plural subject ""People"" with the plural verb ""are.""  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Both sentences use ""they"" appropriately to refer back to ""People.""  
- The phrase ""very hard of hearing"" is idiomatically correct.  
- The conjunction ""and"" properly links the two independent clauses.  

**Conclusion:**  
Sentence B is grammatically correct, while Sentence A contains a subject-verb agreement error."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. Both start the same way: ""These fences, made from heavy gauge wire for durability,"" but then differ in the verb forms.

First, I need to check subject-verb agreement. The main subject here is ""These fences,"" which is plural. So the verbs that follow should agree with a plural subject. 

Looking at Sentence A: ""are three feet high and are buried one foot below the surface."" Both verbs here are ""are,"" which is correct for plural subjects. That seems right.

Now Sentence B: ""is three feet high and are buried one foot below the surface."" The first verb here is ""is,"" which is singular. That's a problem because ""fences"" is plural. The second verb is ""are,"" which is correct, but the first one is wrong. Mixing singular and plural verbs in a compound predicate like this doesn't work. The subject remains plural throughout, so both verbs need to be plural.

Another thing to check is the structure. The part between commas is a participial phrase modifying ""fences,"" so it doesn't affect the subject-verb agreement. The core sentence is ""These fences are three feet high and are buried..."" So Sentence A maintains agreement, while B breaks it with ""is.""

I should also consider if there's any other grammatical issue, but the main one here is definitely subject-verb agreement. Sentence B incorrectly uses ""is"" with a plural subject. So the answer is that Sentence A is grammatical, and B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical.  
**Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement:**  
  The subject ""These fences"" is plural. In Sentence A, the verbs ""are"" (twice) correctly agree with the plural subject.  
  In Sentence B, the first verb ""is"" (singular) incorrectly disagrees with the plural subject ""fences,"" making the sentence ungrammatical.  

- **Structure Consistency:**  
  Sentence A maintains parallel structure in the compound predicate (""are three feet high and are buried..."").  
  Sentence B mixes singular (""is"") and plural (""are"") verbs inconsistently, breaking grammatical parallelism.  

**Key Issue:**  
The error in Sentence B lies in the mismatch between the singular verb ""is"" and the plural subject ""fences."""
11,are,is,3,"These fences, made from heavy gauge wire for durability, are three feet high and are buried one foot below the surface.","These fences, made from heavy gauge wire for durability, is three feet high and are buried one foot below the surface.",21,615,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about fences made from heavy gauge wire. Let me start by reading both sentences carefully.

Sentence A: ""These fences, made from heavy gauge wire for durability, is three feet high and are buried one foot below the surface.""

Sentence B: ""These fences, made from heavy gauge wire for durability, are three feet high and are buried one foot below the surface.""

Hmm, the main difference between them is the verb used after the subject. Sentence A uses ""is"" and ""are,"" while Sentence B uses ""are"" twice. Let me break it down.

First, the subject of both sentences is ""These fences."" Since ""fences"" is plural, the verb should agree in number. The phrase ""made from heavy gauge wire for durability"" is a participial phrase modifying ""fences,"" so it doesn't affect the verb agreement. 

Looking at Sentence A: The verbs are ""is"" and ""are."" The first verb after the subject is ""is,"" which is singular. But ""fences"" is plural, so ""is"" doesn't agree. That's a problem. Then it switches to ""are"" for the second part. But even if the second verb is correct, the first one is wrong, making the whole sentence ungrammatical.

Sentence B uses ""are"" for both parts: ""are three feet high and are buried..."" Since ""are"" is plural, it matches ""fences."" So both verbs agree with the subject. That makes Sentence B correct.

Wait, but maybe there's a compound predicate here. The structure is ""These fences are X and are Y."" Both verbs are part of the same subject, so they both need to agree. In Sentence A, mixing ""is"" and ""are"" is inconsistent. The first verb is wrong, so the sentence is ungrammatical. Sentence B keeps consistency with plural verbs, so it's correct.

I should also check if there's any other issue. The participial phrase is set off by commas, which is correct. No problems there. The main issue is subject-verb agreement. So yes, Sentence A is wrong because of ""is,"" and Sentence B is correct with ""are.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of both sentences is **""These fences""** (plural).  
- In **Sentence A**, the verbs **""is""** (singular) and **""are""** (plural) incorrectly disagree with the plural subject. The phrase **""is three feet high""** should instead use **""are""** to match **""fences.""**  
- In **Sentence B**, both verbs (**""are three feet high""** and **""are buried""**) correctly agree with the plural subject **""fences,""** making the sentence grammatically consistent.  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement. Plural subjects require plural verbs."

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Let me read them again carefully.

Sentence A: ""The performing arts, broadly dance, music and theatre are key elements of culture and engage participants at a number of levels.""

Sentence B: ""The performing arts, broadly dance, music and theatre is key elements of culture and engage participants at a number of levels.""

Hmm, the main difference between them is the verb used after the subject. Sentence A uses ""are"" and Sentence B uses ""is"". So the question is about subject-verb agreement. 

First, I need to identify the subject of the sentence. The main subject here is ""The performing arts"". Then there's an appositive phrase: ""broadly dance, music and theatre"", which explains what the performing arts include. So the core subject is ""The performing arts"", which is a plural noun because ""arts"" is plural. 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""are"", which is plural, matching the plural subject ""performing arts"". That seems correct. Then the sentence continues with ""and engage participants..."". The verb ""engage"" is in the plural form, which also agrees with the plural subject. So ""are"" and ""engage"" both correctly agree with ""the performing arts"".

In Sentence B, the verb is ""is"", which is singular. That doesn't match the plural subject ""performing arts"". So ""is"" would be incorrect here. Additionally, ""is key elements"" is problematic because ""elements"" is plural, so even if the verb were correct, ""is"" doesn't agree with ""elements"". Wait, but the verb is ""is key elements"", which is a problem because ""is"" is singular and ""elements"" is plural. So ""is"" should be ""are"" to agree with ""elements"". But in Sentence B, the verb is ""is"", which is wrong both for the subject and the predicate noun. 

Wait, let me break it down again. The structure of the sentence is: ""The performing arts... are key elements..."" in Sentence A. In Sentence B, it's ""The performing arts... is key elements..."". So the main clause is ""The performing arts are/is key elements..."". The subject is plural, so ""are"" is correct. ""Key elements"" is plural, so ""are"" matches that as well. In Sentence B, using ""is"" would be incorrect because it's singular, and ""elements"" is plural. So ""is key elements"" is ungrammatical. 

Additionally, the second verb in the sentence is ""engage"". In Sentence A, it's ""engage"", which is plural, matching the subject. In Sentence B, it's still ""engage"", but the first verb ""is"" is wrong. So even if the second verb is correct, the first one is wrong. 

So Sentence A is correct because the verbs ""are"" and ""engage"" agree with the plural subject ""the performing arts"". Sentence B is incorrect because ""is"" doesn't agree with the plural subject, and ""is key elements"" is also a mismatch. 

Wait, but let me check if ""the performing arts"" is considered singular or plural. Sometimes collective nouns can be tricky. For example, ""the team is"" vs. ""the team are"". But in American English, collective nouns are usually treated as singular. However, ""the performing arts"" refers to multiple disciplines (dance, music, theatre), so it's plural. Therefore, ""the performing arts are"" is correct. 

Another point: the appositive phrase ""broadly dance, music and theatre"" is set off by commas, which is correct. It's giving examples of the performing arts. So that part is fine in both sentences. 

So the main issue is subject-verb agreement. Sentence A uses plural verbs correctly, while Sentence B incorrectly uses a singular verb ""is"" with a plural subject. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Key Explanation:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - The subject of the sentence is **""The performing arts""**, which is plural (referring to multiple disciplines: dance, music, theatre).  
   - Sentence A correctly uses the plural verb **""are""** to agree with the plural subject.  
   - Sentence B incorrectly uses the singular verb **""is""**, which clashes with the plural subject.  

2. **Predicate Noun Agreement**:  
   - In Sentence A, **""are key elements""** matches the plural subject and predicate noun (""elements"").  
   - In Sentence B, **""is key elements""** is doubly flawed: ""is"" (singular) conflicts with both the plural subject and the plural noun ""elements"".  

3. **Second Verb Consistency**:  
   - Sentence A uses **""engage""** (plural), which aligns with the plural subject.  
   - Sentence B retains **""engage""**, but the initial error (""is"") already renders the sentence ungrammatical.  

### Conclusion:  
Sentence A maintains proper agreement throughout, while Sentence B violates subject-verb and predicate noun agreement rules."
10,are,is,3,"The performing arts, broadly dance, music and theatre are key elements of culture and engage participants at a number of levels.","The performing arts, broadly dance, music and theatre is key elements of culture and engage participants at a number of levels.",21,998,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about the performing arts being key elements of culture. 

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B. The subject here is ""The performing arts,"" which is a plural noun because ""arts"" is plural. So, the verb should agree with the plural subject.

In Sentence A, the verb is ""is,"" which is singular. That's a problem because the subject is plural. Even though there's an appositive phrase (""broadly dance, music and theatre"") between commas, the main subject remains ""The performing arts,"" which is plural. So the verb should be ""are"" instead of ""is."" 

Looking at Sentence B, the verb is ""are,"" which correctly matches the plural subject. Then there's another verb ""engage,"" which is in the correct plural form as well. So both verbs in Sentence B agree with the plural subject. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes, even if the subject seems plural, if it's considered a single entity, it might take a singular verb. For example, ""The Beatles is a great band"" vs. ""The Beatles are performing."" But in this case, ""performing arts"" is definitely plural. It refers to multiple art forms, so ""are"" is correct. 

Also, the appositive phrase adds more information but doesn't change the number of the subject. So the verbs should still agree with ""The performing arts."" Therefore, Sentence A is incorrect because it uses ""is,"" and Sentence B is correct with ""are.""
</think>

**Answer:**  

**Sentence B** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Explanation:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - The subject of the sentence is **""The performing arts""** (plural).  
   - In **Sentence A**, the verb **""is""** (singular) incorrectly agrees with the plural subject.  
   - In **Sentence B**, the verb **""are""** (plural) correctly matches the plural subject.  

2. **Appositive Phrase**:  
   - The phrase **""broadly dance, music and theatre""** is an appositive that adds detail but does not affect the grammatical number of the subject. The core subject (""performing arts"") remains plural.  

3. **Parallel Structure**:  
   - Both verbs (**""are""** and **""engage""**) in Sentence B agree with the plural subject, maintaining grammatical consistency.  

**Correct Sentence (B):**  
*The performing arts, broadly dance, music and theatre, are key elements of culture and engage participants at a number of levels.*  

**Key Error in Sentence A:**  
Using **""is""** (singular) with a plural subject creates a subject-verb disagreement."
13,is,are,3,The total number of deadly accidents including the estimates for the early years is 772.,The total number of deadly accidents including the estimates for the early years are 772.,15,1694,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about the total number of deadly accidents. The difference is ""is"" vs. ""are"" in the verb.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement. The main subject here is ""the total number."" Now, ""number"" is singular, right? So the verb should agree with that. Even though ""accidents"" is plural, the subject is ""number,"" which is singular. So ""is"" would be correct. That would make Sentence A correct and B incorrect.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused because of the prepositional phrases that come after the subject. Like in this case, ""of deadly accidents including..."" might make someone think the verb should agree with ""accidents."" But no, the subject is still ""number,"" so the verb should be singular. 

Let me check an example. ""The number of students is increasing."" Here, ""number"" is singular, so ""is"" is correct. Similarly, ""A number of students are attending."" Here, ""a number of"" is a phrase meaning ""several,"" so the verb is plural. But in the original sentences, it's ""the total number,"" which is definitely singular. So yeah, Sentence A is correct. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is plural, so it's wrong.

Another thing to consider: sometimes modifiers between the subject and verb can trip people up. In Sentence A and B, there's a long phrase after ""accidents,"" but the subject is still ""number."" So the verb should still be singular. 

So conclusion: Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""the total number""* (singular), so the verb must agree with it. Even though the phrase *""of deadly accidents...""* includes a plural noun (*accidents*), the verb depends on the singular subject *""number.""*  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses *""is""* (singular verb).  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses *""are""* (plural verb), which clashes with the singular subject.  

This is a common error caused by intervening phrases (e.g., *""including the estimates...""*) distracting from the main subject. Always identify the core subject to ensure proper agreement."
13,is,are,3,The total number of deadly accidents including the estimates for the early years is 772.,The total number of deadly accidents including the estimates for the early years are 772.,15,1694,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb: ""are"" in A and ""is"" in B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The subject here is ""the total number of deadly accidents..."" even though there's a modifying phrase ""including the estimates for the early years."" So the core subject is ""the total number,"" which is singular. 

Wait, right, ""number"" is singular, so it should take a singular verb. That would mean ""is"" is correct. So sentence B uses ""is,"" which matches the singular subject. Sentence A uses ""are,"" which is plural, so that's incorrect. 

But sometimes people get confused because of the prepositional phrases that come after the subject. Like, if the subject were ""accidents,"" which is plural, then ""are"" would be correct. But here, the subject is ""number,"" not ""accidents."" The phrase ""of deadly accidents"" is just describing what the number refers to. So the verb has to agree with ""number,"" not ""accidents.""

So sentence B is correct because ""the total number... is 772."" Sentence A is wrong because it uses ""are"" with a singular subject. 

I should also check if the modifying phrase ""including the estimates..."" affects the subject. But no, that's just additional information. The main subject is still ""the total number."" So the verb must agree with that. 

Therefore, the answer is that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""The total number""**, which is singular. The verb must agree with the singular subject, so **""is""** (singular) is correct.  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses **""are""** (plural), which mistakenly agrees with the plural noun **""accidents""** instead of the singular subject **""number""**.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses **""is""** to match the singular subject **""number""**, even though the phrase **""including the estimates...""** adds extra information.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
The verb must agree with the grammatical subject (**""number""**), not with intervening phrases or modifiers (**""accidents""**)."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are pretty similar, so I need to look closely at the differences.

First, I'll read both sentences again to spot the differences. The main difference I notice is the verb in the middle: Sentence A uses ""run"" while Sentence B uses ""runs"". The rest of the sentence structure seems the same. 

The subject of the verb is ""separate collections for garden and food waste"". Let's check if that's singular or plural. ""Collections"" is plural, so the verb should agree with that. ""Run"" is plural, and ""runs"" is singular. So, ""collections... run"" would be correct. Therefore, Sentence A uses ""run"" which matches the plural subject, so it should be correct. Sentence B uses ""runs"", which is singular, so that would be incorrect. 

Wait, but let me double-check. The structure is ""separate collections... typically run... and share..."". Both ""run"" and ""share"" are verbs connected to the subject. Since ""collections"" is plural, both verbs need to be plural. In Sentence A, ""run"" and ""share"" are both plural. In Sentence B, ""runs"" is singular, which doesn't agree with the plural subject. So Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the verb ""runs"". 

Another thing to check: are there any other potential issues? The phrase ""intervening fortnightly weeks to those of municipal waste"" might be a bit awkward, but that's present in both sentences. The user is specifically asking about grammaticality, so the main issue is subject-verb agreement. 

So, conclusion: Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is not because of the incorrect verb form ""runs"".
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Explanation:  
The key difference lies in **subject-verb agreement**:  
- The subject is **""separate collections for garden and food waste""** (plural).  
- In **Sentence A**, the verbs **""run""** and **""share""** correctly agree with the plural subject.  
- In **Sentence B**, the verb **""runs""** (singular) incorrectly disagrees with the plural subject.  

### Additional Notes:  
- The phrase **""intervening fortnightly weeks to those of municipal waste""** is awkward but structurally identical in both sentences. The primary grammatical error in Sentence B is the singular verb **""runs""**.  
- Sentence A maintains grammatical consistency by using plural verbs (**run**, **share**) to match the plural subject (**collections**)."
11,run,runs,3,"If applicable, separate collections for garden and food waste typically run on intervening fortnightly weeks to those of municipal waste and share infrastructure and transport.","If applicable, separate collections for garden and food waste typically runs on intervening fortnightly weeks to those of municipal waste and share infrastructure and transport.",25,1809,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are quite similar, but there's a difference in the verb form: ""runs"" in Sentence A and ""run"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to identify the subject of the verb. The main clause in both sentences starts with ""separate collections for garden and food waste."" The subject here is ""collections,"" which is plural because it refers to multiple instances of collection. 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""runs,"" which is singular. That doesn't agree with the plural subject ""collections."" So that's a problem. In Sentence B, the verb is ""run,"" which is plural, matching the subject. That should be correct.

But wait, maybe there's a compound subject? Let me check again. The sentence says ""separate collections... typically runs/run... and share..."" So the verbs are ""runs/run"" and ""share."" If ""collections"" is the subject, then both verbs need to agree. ""Share"" is plural, which matches. So in Sentence A, ""runs"" is singular while ""share"" is plural, which is inconsistent. In Sentence B, both ""run"" and ""share"" are plural, so they agree with the plural subject. 

Therefore, Sentence B is correct because the verbs agree in number with the plural subject ""collections."" Sentence A is incorrect because ""runs"" doesn't agree with the plural subject. 

I should also check if there are any other issues, like preposition use or word order, but the main difference is the verb conjugation. The rest of the sentence structure seems the same in both. So the conclusion is that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb is ""separate collections"" (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb ""runs"" (*""collections... runs""*), which does not match the plural subject.  
- Sentence B correctly uses the plural verb ""run"" (*""collections... run""*), ensuring subject-verb agreement.  

The rest of the sentence structure (e.g., ""share infrastructure and transport"") is consistent in both versions, but the error in Sentence A makes it ungrammatical."
10,are,is,3,"The most common complications of the posterior pharyngeal wall flap are hyponasality, nasal obstruction, snoring, and sleep apnea.","The most common complications of the posterior pharyngeal wall flap is hyponasality, nasal obstruction, snoring, and sleep apnea.",18,2010,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both talking about complications of a posterior pharyngeal wall flap. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""the most common complications,"" which is plural because ""complications"" is plural. The verb should agree with the subject in number. So, a plural subject takes a plural verb. ""Are"" is plural, and ""is"" is singular. Therefore, Sentence A uses ""are,"" which matches the plural subject, making it correct. Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is singular and doesn't agree with the plural subject, so it's incorrect.

Wait, but let me double-check. The structure is ""The most common complications... are..."" because the subject is ""complications."" Even though the list after the verb includes multiple items, the verb still needs to agree with the subject, not the items listed. So yes, ""complications"" is plural, so ""are"" is correct. Sentence B is wrong because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject.

Another way to test this is to simplify the sentence. If I remove the prepositional phrases, the core is ""Complications are..."" or ""Complications is..."" Clearly, ""Complications are"" is correct. So Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical due to subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""the most common complications""** (plural).  
- The verb must agree with the plural subject, so **""are""** (plural) is correct in **Sentence A**.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular), which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement. Plural subjects require plural verbs."
10,are,is,3,"The most common complications of the posterior pharyngeal wall flap are hyponasality, nasal obstruction, snoring, and sleep apnea.","The most common complications of the posterior pharyngeal wall flap is hyponasality, nasal obstruction, snoring, and sleep apnea.",18,2010,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both talking about complications of a posterior pharyngeal wall flap. The main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, the key here is to identify the subject in each sentence and determine if it's singular or plural.

Looking at both sentences, the subject is ""The most common complications of the posterior pharyngeal wall flap."" Wait, ""complications"" is plural, right? So the subject is plural. Therefore, the verb should agree with a plural subject. That would mean using ""are"" instead of ""is.""

But wait, let me double-check. Sometimes, even if the subject seems plural, there might be cases where it's considered singular. For example, if the subject is a collective noun or if the main noun is singular despite other modifiers. Let me look again. The subject starts with ""The most common complications..."" So ""complications"" is definitely plural. The verb that follows should be plural as well. So ""are"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject.

Another way to test this is to simplify the sentence. Remove the prepositional phrases and modifiers to get to the core subject and verb. The core of the sentence is ""Complications are..."" which is correct. If it were ""Complication is..."" that would be singular. But here, it's plural, so ""are"" is needed.

So, Sentence B uses the correct plural verb ""are"" to match the plural subject ""complications,"" making it grammatical. Sentence A incorrectly uses ""is,"" which doesn't agree in number with the subject, making it ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""The most common complications""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb) with a plural subject.  
- Sentence B correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject.  

**Key Fix:**  
- **A (incorrect):** ""...complications **is**...""  
- **B (correct):** ""...complications **are**...""  

The list of complications (hyponasality, nasal obstruction, etc.) reinforces that the subject is plural, requiring a plural verb."
15,indicate,indicates,3,"Short stubby paragraphs throughout lead to poor prose flow, and even without reading thoroughly indicate there are more significant prose issues lurking.","Short stubby paragraphs throughout lead to poor prose flow, and even without reading thoroughly indicates there are more significant prose issues lurking.",22,2555,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both very similar except for the verb after ""indicate/indicates."" 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the verb in question. The sentence structure is a bit complex. Let's break it down. Both sentences start with ""Short stubby paragraphs throughout lead to poor prose flow,"" which is a complete clause. Then there's ""and even without reading thoroughly indicate/indicates there are more significant prose issues lurking.""

The key part here is the second part after ""and."" The user is probably confused about whether ""indicate"" should be plural or singular. So, the subject of ""indicate/indicates"" is crucial. Let's look at the structure. The phrase ""even without reading thoroughly"" is a parenthetical or an adverbial phrase, so it doesn't affect the subject. The main clause after ""and"" should have a subject and a verb. 

The subject here is ""short stubby paragraphs throughout."" Wait, but ""throughout"" is part of the first clause. Let me check again. The first clause is ""Short stubby paragraphs throughout lead to poor prose flow."" Then the second part is connected by ""and."" So the structure is: [Subject] [verb] ... , and [something else]. The second part needs its own subject and verb. But in both sentences, the second part starts with ""even without reading thoroughly indicate..."" So maybe the subject is the same as the first clause? That is, ""short stubby paragraphs throughout"" are the subject for both clauses connected by ""and.""

If that's the case, then the verb should agree with the subject. The subject is plural (""paragraphs""), so the verb should be plural. In sentence A, it's ""indicate,"" which is plural. In sentence B, it's ""indicates,"" which is singular. Therefore, sentence A should be correct because the plural subject requires a plural verb. 

But wait, maybe there's a different subject in the second clause. Let me parse the sentence again. The second part is ""even without reading thoroughly indicate..."" Could the subject here be ""short stubby paragraphs""? If so, then yes, plural. But sometimes, when there's an intervening phrase, people might get confused. However, ""even without reading thoroughly"" is an adverbial phrase, so the subject remains ""short stubby paragraphs."" Therefore, ""indicate"" is correct. So sentence A is grammatical, and B is not because it uses ""indicates"" with a plural subject.

Another angle: maybe the subject is different. For example, if the second clause had a different subject, like ""they"" (referring to the paragraphs), but in the given sentences, there's no explicit subject. So the structure is a compound predicate? Wait, the first clause is ""lead to poor prose flow,"" and the second is ""indicate..."" So if both verbs share the same subject, then yes, ""paragraphs... lead... and indicate..."" So both verbs are connected by ""and"" and share the plural subject. Therefore, both verbs should be plural. ""Lead"" is plural (correct), and ""indicate"" should be plural. So sentence A is correct, B is wrong because ""indicates"" is singular.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The key difference lies in the verb **""indicate""** (Sentence A) vs. **""indicates""** (Sentence B). The subject of the verb is the plural noun phrase **""short stubby paragraphs throughout""**. Since the subject is plural, the verb must agree in number, requiring the plural form **""indicate""**.  

In Sentence B, **""indicates""** incorrectly uses the singular form for a plural subject, making it ungrammatical. The intervening phrase **""even without reading thoroughly""** does not affect subject-verb agreement; the core subject (""paragraphs"") remains plural.  

**Grammatical Structure Simplified:**  
- *Short stubby paragraphs [...] **lead** [...] and **indicate** [...]* (plural subject → plural verbs).  
- Sentence B incorrectly pairs a plural subject with a singular verb (**indicates**)."
15,indicate,indicates,3,"Short stubby paragraphs throughout lead to poor prose flow, and even without reading thoroughly indicate there are more significant prose issues lurking.","Short stubby paragraphs throughout lead to poor prose flow, and even without reading thoroughly indicates there are more significant prose issues lurking.",22,2555,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are very similar, but there's a difference in the verb used after ""even without reading thoroughly."" Sentence A uses ""indicates"" and Sentence B uses ""indicate."" 

First, I need to figure out the subject that the verb is referring to. The sentences start with ""Short stubby paragraphs throughout lead to poor prose flow,"" which is a complete clause. Then there's a conjunction ""and"" connecting it to the next part: ""even without reading thoroughly indicates/indicate there are more significant prose issues lurking.""

So, the structure is: [First clause], and [second clause]. The second clause should have its own subject and verb. Let's look at the second part. The phrase ""even without reading thoroughly"" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial modifier. The main verb here is either ""indicates"" or ""indicate."" The subject of this verb must be a noun phrase. 

But what is the subject here? The first clause's subject is ""Short stubby paragraphs,"" but the second clause is connected by ""and,"" so it should have its own subject. However, in both sentences, the second clause seems to start with ""even without reading thoroughly,"" which isn't a noun phrase. That makes me think that maybe the subject is implied or perhaps there's a gerund or something else. 

Wait, ""even without reading thoroughly"" is a modifier. The actual subject might be the entire idea from the first clause. But that doesn't make sense because the verb needs a clear subject. Alternatively, maybe the subject is a gerund phrase. Let's parse the second clause: ""even without reading thoroughly indicates/indicate..."" Hmm. If the subject is ""reading thoroughly,"" but that's part of the prepositional phrase ""without reading thoroughly."" So the subject isn't ""reading thoroughly."" 

Alternatively, maybe the subject is the entire first clause. For example, ""Short stubby paragraphs...lead..., and [that] even without reading thoroughly indicates..."" But that would require ""that"" to refer back, which isn't present. So perhaps the structure is faulty here. 

Wait, maybe the second clause is missing a subject. Let's see. The first clause is ""Short stubby paragraphs throughout lead to poor prose flow."" The second clause is ""even without reading thoroughly indicates/indicate..."" So the second clause is missing a subject. The verb ""indicates"" needs a subject. If the subject is implied to be the same as the first clause's subject, but that doesn't make sense because ""short stubby paragraphs"" can't ""indicate"" something. 

Wait, maybe the subject is the entire situation described in the first clause. For example, the fact that there are short stubby paragraphs leading to poor prose flow, even without reading thoroughly, indicates... But in that case, the subject would be a noun phrase like ""the fact"" or ""this situation,"" which isn't present. So the sentence is using a participle or gerund structure incorrectly. 

Alternatively, maybe ""even without reading thoroughly"" is a participial phrase modifying the subject. But then the subject would need to be the entity doing the indicating. For example, ""Reading thoroughly indicates..."" but here it's ""even without reading thoroughly indicates..."" which is confusing. 

Wait, perhaps the intended subject is ""the presence of short stubby paragraphs"" or something like that. But the way the sentence is structured, the second clause doesn't have a clear subject. So the verb ""indicates"" or ""indicate"" is lacking a subject. 

In Sentence A, ""indicates"" is singular, and in Sentence B, ""indicate"" is plural. If the subject is something singular, like ""the fact"" or ""this,"" then ""indicates"" would be correct. If the subject is plural, like ""short stubby paragraphs,"" then ""indicate"" would be correct. But the problem is that the subject isn't explicitly stated in the second clause. 

Wait, maybe the structure is different. Let's look again. The first part is ""Short stubby paragraphs...lead to poor prose flow,"" and the second part is connected by ""and."" The second part is ""even without reading thoroughly indicates/indicate there are more issues."" So maybe the subject of the second clause is ""short stubby paragraphs"" again, but that doesn't make sense because the verb would need to agree. If the subject is ""short stubby paragraphs,"" then the verb should be plural ""indicate."" But the first clause already used ""lead,"" which is plural, agreeing with ""paragraphs."" 

But in the second clause, the structure is ""even without reading thoroughly indicate..."" So if ""paragraphs"" is the subject, then ""indicate"" would be correct. But does that make sense? The sentence would be saying that the paragraphs lead to poor flow and (the paragraphs) indicate there are more issues. But the phrase ""even without reading thoroughly"" is modifying the indicating. So the meaning would be that the paragraphs themselves, even without someone reading thoroughly, indicate that there are more issues. That makes sense. So in that case, the subject of ""indicate"" is ""short stubby paragraphs,"" so the verb should be plural ""indicate,"" which is Sentence B. 

But in Sentence A, it's ""indicates,"" which is singular. That would be incorrect if the subject is ""paragraphs."" So Sentence B would be correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the subject is a different singular noun. For example, if the subject is ""the presence of short stubby paragraphs,"" but that's not stated. The original subject is ""paragraphs,"" which is plural. Therefore, the verb should agree with the plural subject, making Sentence B correct. 

So the error in Sentence A is using a singular verb ""indicates"" with a plural subject ""paragraphs."" Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Analysis:**

Both sentences attempt to connect two clauses with ""and,"" but the second clause in each has a subject-verb agreement issue. The key is identifying the subject of the second verb (""indicates"" or ""indicate""):

1. **Sentence A** uses ""indicates"" (singular).  
   - The implied subject of the second clause is **""short stubby paragraphs""** (plural).  
   - **Error**: ""Indicates"" (singular) does not agree with the plural subject.  

2. **Sentence B** uses ""indicate"" (plural).  
   - Correctly matches the plural subject ""short stubby paragraphs.""  
   - The phrase ""even without reading thoroughly"" is an adverbial modifier and does not affect subject-verb agreement.  

**Conclusion:**  
- **Sentence B is grammatical** (plural verb ""indicate"" agrees with plural subject).  
- **Sentence A is ungrammatical** (singular verb ""indicates"" incorrectly paired with plural subject).  

**Reasoning:**  
The second clause implicitly refers back to the plural subject ""short stubby paragraphs,"" which ""lead to poor prose flow"" and also ""indicate"" deeper issues. The verb must agree in number with the subject."

Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are about a pair of escalators and lifts heading down to the platform level. The difference between them is ""heads"" vs. ""head"" in the verb.

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The main subject here is ""A pair of escalators and lifts past these gates."" Wait, but ""a pair"" is singular, right? So ""a pair... heads down"" would be correct if the subject is ""pair."" But then there's ""escalators and lifts"" which are plural. Hmm, maybe the user is confused about subject-verb agreement here.

Let me break it down. The sentence structure is: ""A pair (of escalators and lifts) past these gates [heads/head] down..."" The phrase ""of escalators and lifts"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""pair."" So the main subject is ""a pair,"" which is singular. Therefore, the verb should agree with the singular subject. That would make ""heads"" correct in Sentence A. But wait, the sentence has ""a pair of escalators and lifts."" Wait, is ""a pair"" referring to both escalators and lifts, or just one of them? Because a pair usually means two items. So if there's a pair of escalators and lifts, maybe the pair includes both, but ""escalators and lifts"" are plural. But the subject is still ""a pair,"" which is singular. So the verb should be ""heads."" So Sentence A is correct. Sentence B uses ""head,"" which is plural, but the subject is singular, so B is incorrect.

But wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Sometimes when we have ""a pair of..."" followed by a plural noun, the verb can sometimes be plural if the emphasis is on the individual items rather than the pair as a single unit. For example, ""A pair of shoes are on the bed"" vs. ""A pair of shoes is on the bed."" Both are possible depending on whether you're considering them as a single unit or individual items. But in this case, the sentence is structured with ""a pair of escalators and lifts."" Wait, escalators and lifts are two different things. A pair would typically consist of two items. So if it's a pair of escalators and lifts, that might actually be three items: two escalators and one lift? Or maybe two of each? The wording is a bit unclear. But regardless, the subject is ""a pair,"" which is singular. So the verb should be ""heads."" Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and B is ungrammatical.

But let me double-check. If the subject were ""escalators and lifts,"" then the verb would need to be plural. But in this case, the subject is ""a pair,"" so even though the pair consists of multiple items, the word ""pair"" is singular. So the verb should agree with ""pair,"" not the items in the pair. Therefore, ""heads"" is correct. So Sentence A is correct, B is wrong.
</think>

The grammatical sentence is **Sentence A**: ""A pair of escalators and lifts past these gates heads down to the platform level.""  

### Explanation:  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: The subject is ""a pair"" (singular), so the verb must agree with ""pair"" (singular: *heads*).  
- **Why Sentence B is incorrect**: Using ""head"" (plural verb) incorrectly disagrees with the singular subject ""a pair.""  

### Key Notes:  
- Phrases like ""of escalators and lifts"" or ""past these gates"" are modifiers and do not affect the verb's number.  
- Even though ""escalators and lifts"" are plural, the core subject (""pair"") remains singular.  

**Ungrammatical Sentence**: Sentence B."
9,heads,head,3,A pair of escalators and lifts past these gates heads down to the platform level.,A pair of escalators and lifts past these gates head down to the platform level.,15,2798,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb: ""head"" vs. ""heads"". 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The subject is ""A pair of escalators and lifts past these gates"". Wait, ""a pair"" is singular, right? So ""a pair"" would take a singular verb. But then there's ""escalators and lifts"" which are plural. Hmm, maybe the subject is ""a pair"", so the verb should agree with ""pair"".

But wait, sometimes when you have a phrase like ""a pair of X"", the verb can be singular if you're referring to the pair as a single unit. For example, ""A pair of shoes is on the bed."" But if the sentence is ""A pair of shoes are on the bed,"" that's also possible if you're thinking of them as two separate items. But in this case, the sentence structure might be more complex because there's ""escalators and lifts"" after ""pair of"". Wait, the original sentence is ""A pair of escalators and lifts..."". Wait, is it ""a pair of [escalators and lifts]"" or ""a pair of escalators"" and ""lifts""? That might be ambiguous. 

Wait, the structure is ""A pair of escalators and lifts past these gates head/heads down..."". So ""a pair of escalators and lifts"" – but ""pair"" usually refers to two things. So if it's a pair (two) of escalators and lifts, that might be confusing because escalators and lifts are different. Maybe the intended meaning is that there's a pair (two) of escalators and some lifts. But the way it's written, ""a pair of escalators and lifts"" could be interpreted as a pair consisting of both escalators and lifts, which might not make sense because a pair is two items. So maybe the subject is ""a pair of escalators and lifts"", but that's actually three things: two escalators and some lifts. Wait, no, ""a pair"" would be two, so ""a pair of escalators"" would be two escalators, and then ""lifts"" (elevators) are additional. So the subject is ""A pair of escalators and lifts"", meaning two escalators and some lifts. But then the verb needs to agree with the subject. If the subject is plural (""escalators and lifts""), then the verb should be plural. But the sentence starts with ""A pair"", which is singular. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is ""A pair of [escalators and lifts] past these gates"". So the pair includes both escalators and lifts. But a pair is two items, so maybe one escalator and one lift? But that's not clear. The user might have made a mistake in the sentence structure. 

But regardless, the main question is whether the verb should be ""head"" or ""heads"". If the subject is ""a pair"", then it's singular and should take ""heads"". If the subject is ""escalators and lifts"", then it's plural and should take ""head"". So which is the subject here?

The sentence structure is: ""A pair of escalators and lifts past these gates head/heads down..."" The main noun phrase is ""A pair of escalators and lifts"". The phrase ""past these gates"" is a prepositional phrase modifying the subject. So the core subject is ""A pair of escalators and lifts"". Now, ""a pair"" is the head noun here. Even though ""escalators and lifts"" are plural, the main subject is ""a pair"", which is singular. Therefore, the verb should agree with ""pair"", making it singular: ""heads"". So sentence B would be correct. 

But wait, sometimes when you have a phrase like ""a pair of X"", the verb can be plural if the focus is on the individual items. For example, ""A pair of shoes are on the bed"" (if considering them as two separate shoes). But in this case, ""a pair of escalators and lifts"" – if ""pair"" refers to two items, but ""escalators and lifts"" are more than two, then maybe the subject is actually plural. Wait, no. If it's ""a pair of escalators and lifts"", that would mean two items: maybe one escalator and one lift? But that's not standard. Usually, a pair refers to two of the same thing. So maybe the sentence is structured incorrectly. But regardless, grammatically, the subject is ""a pair"", so the verb should be singular. Therefore, sentence B is correct. 

But let me check again. If the subject is ""a pair"", then ""heads"" is correct. If the subject is ""escalators and lifts"", then ""head"" is correct. But the way the sentence is structured, ""a pair of escalators and lifts"" – the ""of"" applies to ""escalators and lifts"", making the pair consist of those. But a pair is two items, so maybe two escalators and two lifts? Or one escalator and one lift? The sentence is a bit unclear. However, grammatically, the verb should agree with ""pair"", which is singular. So sentence B is correct. 

Therefore, sentence B is grammatical, and sentence A is ungrammatical because it uses the plural verb ""head"" with a singular subject ""a pair"".
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The subject of the sentence is **""a pair""** (singular), not ""escalators and lifts."" The phrase ""of escalators and lifts"" modifies ""pair"" but does not change the grammatical number of the subject. Since ""a pair"" is singular, the verb must agree with it by using the singular form **""heads""**.  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses **""head""** (plural verb) with the singular subject ""a pair.""  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses **""heads""** (singular verb) to match the singular subject.  

### Key Grammar Rule:  
Verbs must agree in number with their subjects. Collective nouns like ""pair,"" ""group,"" or ""team"" are singular when treated as a single unit.  

**Ungrammatical (A):**  
*A pair of escalators and lifts past these gates **head** down...*  
**Grammatical (B):**

17,kills,kill,3,"June-the greenock rail accident, caused by vandals placing concrete blocks on the rails, kills two people.","June-the greenock rail accident, caused by vandals placing concrete blocks on the rails, kill two people.",16,2808,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about the Greenock rail accident in June, caused by vandals placing concrete blocks on the rails, resulting in two deaths.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""kills"" in Sentence A and ""kill"" in Sentence B. The subject here is ""June-the Greenock rail accident."" Wait, actually, the subject is ""the Greenock rail accident,"" right? ""June"" is part of the name or the date? Maybe it's written as ""June-the Greenock rail accident,"" but that seems a bit odd. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be ""June's Greenock rail accident"" or ""The June Greenock rail accident."" But assuming the user wrote it as ""June-the Greenock rail accident,"" perhaps it's a title or a specific way of referring to the accident. 

But regardless, the core subject is ""accident,"" which is a singular noun. So the verb should agree with a singular subject. ""Accident"" is singular, so the verb should be ""kills"" (third person singular). Sentence A uses ""kills,"" which would be correct. Sentence B uses ""kill,"" which is plural, so that would be incorrect because the subject is singular. 

Wait, but let me check again. The structure is: [Subject], [relative clause], [verb]. The subject is ""the Greenock rail accident,"" which is modified by ""caused by vandals placing concrete blocks on the rails."" The main verb is either ""kills"" or ""kill."" Since the subject is singular (""accident""), the verb should be ""kills."" Therefore, Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect because it uses ""kill,"" which is plural. 

But maybe there's a confusion with the intervening phrase. Sometimes people get confused when there's a phrase between the subject and the verb. For example, if the subject were ""vandals,"" then ""kill"" would be correct. But in this case, the subject is ""accident,"" and the phrase ""caused by vandals..."" is just providing additional information. So the verb must agree with ""accident,"" not ""vandals."" 

So yes, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of subject-verb agreement. The accident (singular) kills (singular) two people. If it were the vandals who kill, then ""kill"" would be correct, but here the accident is the cause, so the verb should agree with ""accident.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of both sentences is **""the Greenock rail accident""** (singular). The verb must agree with this singular subject.  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""kills""** (singular verb) to match the singular subject.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""kill""** (plural verb), which clashes with the singular subject.  

The phrase **""caused by vandals placing concrete blocks on the rails""** is a non-essential clause and does not affect subject-verb agreement. The focus remains on **""the accident""** as the singular subject.  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement.  
**Correct:** *The accident ... **kills** two people.*  
**Incorrect:** *The accident ... **kill** two people.*"
17,kills,kill,3,"June-the greenock rail accident, caused by vandals placing concrete blocks on the rails, kills two people.","June-the greenock rail accident, caused by vandals placing concrete blocks on the rails, kill two people.",16,2808,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about the Greenock rail accident in June, caused by vandals placing concrete blocks on the rails, and the result is that two people were killed.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""kill"" in Sentence A and ""kills"" in Sentence B. The subject here is ""June-the Greenock rail accident."" Wait, actually, the way it's written is a bit confusing. Let me parse that again. The sentence starts with ""June-the Greenock rail accident..."" Maybe there's a typo here. Perhaps it's meant to be ""The June Greenock rail accident..."" or ""June's Greenock rail accident...""? The original has a hyphen, so maybe it's a compound subject? Hmm, but ""June-the Greenock rail accident"" doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's a date followed by the event. Like ""June - the Greenock rail accident..."" but the hyphen might be a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be ""In June, the Greenock rail accident..."" but the user wrote it as ""June-the..."" So perhaps the user intended the accident to be named ""June-the Greenock rail accident,"" but that seems unlikely. Maybe it's a formatting error. Let me assume that the subject is ""the Greenock rail accident"" that happened in June, so the correct phrasing would be ""The June Greenock rail accident..."" or ""June's Greenock rail accident..."" But the way it's written is ""June-the Greenock rail accident,"" which is a bit confusing. Maybe the user meant to separate the month and the event with a dash, like ""June - the Greenock rail accident..."" which would make more sense. But in the original sentences, there's no space after the hyphen, so it's ""June-the..."" which might be a typo. 

Assuming that the subject is ""the Greenock rail accident,"" which is a singular event, then the verb needs to agree with that. So the accident (singular) causes something. The main clause is ""the Greenock rail accident... kill(s) two people."" So the verb should be ""kills"" because the subject is singular. Therefore, Sentence B uses ""kills,"" which is correct, and Sentence A uses ""kill,"" which is incorrect because it's plural. 

But wait, the accident is the subject, so ""accident kills"" is correct. The phrase in between the commas is a parenthetical clause explaining the cause. So the core sentence is ""The Greenock rail accident kills two people."" So ""kills"" is the correct third person singular form. Therefore, Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect because it uses ""kill,"" which is plural, not matching the singular subject. 

Another thing to check: the accident is in June. The way it's written is ""June-the Greenock rail accident..."" Maybe the user intended to write ""In June, the Greenock rail accident..."" but missed the comma. If that's the case, then the structure would be ""In June, the Greenock rail accident..., kills two people."" But even then, the verb should still be ""kills."" 

Alternatively, if ""June"" is part of the subject, like ""June's Greenock rail accident,"" then it's still singular. So regardless of how the date is attached, the subject is singular, requiring ""kills."" Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The core issue is **subject-verb agreement**.  

- **Subject**: ""The Greenock rail accident"" (singular).  
- **Verb**: The accident **""kills""** (singular) two people.  

In **Sentence A**, the verb ""kill"" (plural) incorrectly disagrees with the singular subject ""accident.""  
In **Sentence B**, the verb ""kills"" (singular) correctly matches the singular subject.  

### Additional Notes:  
- The phrase ""caused by vandals placing concrete blocks on the rails"" is a parenthetical clause and does not affect subject-verb agreement.  
- The phrasing ""June-the Greenock rail accident"" is likely a typo or formatting error. It should read as ""The June Greenock rail accident"" or ""In June, the Greenock rail accident..."" to clarify the timeline.  

**Corrected Sentence**:  
*""The June Greenock rail accident, caused by vandals placing concrete blocks on the rails, kills two people.""*"
10,include,includes,3,"The institutions of higher learning with a presence on campus include clayton state university, gordon state college and southern crescent technical college.","The institutions of higher learning with a presence on campus includes clayton state university, gordon state college and southern crescent technical college.",22,3392,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about institutions of higher learning. The main difference between them is the verb: Sentence A uses ""include"" and Sentence B uses ""includes"". 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, the key here is to identify the subject of the sentence and determine if it's singular or plural.

Looking at both sentences, the main clause starts with ""The institutions of higher learning with a presence on campus..."" The subject here is ""institutions"", which is plural because it's referring to multiple institutions. The verb that follows should agree with this plural subject. 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""include"", which is the plural form. That makes sense because ""institutions"" is plural. So ""include"" matches in number. 

Sentence B uses ""includes"", which is singular. That would be correct if the subject were singular, like ""institution"", but here the subject is plural. So ""includes"" doesn't agree with the plural subject. Therefore, Sentence B is incorrect.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come after the subject. For example, if there's a prepositional phrase between the subject and verb, it might trick someone into using the wrong verb form. In this case, the subject is ""institutions"", and ""of higher learning with a presence on campus"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""institutions"". The verb should still agree with ""institutions"", not with anything in the prepositional phrase. So even though ""presence"" is singular, it doesn't affect the verb. The verb depends on the main subject, which is plural.

Another thing to check is the list that follows. The institutions listed are three different colleges, which reinforces that there are multiple institutions, so the plural verb is needed. 

So, putting it all together: Sentence A is correct because ""institutions"" (plural) pairs with ""include"" (plural). Sentence B is incorrect because it uses ""includes"" (singular) with a plural subject. 

I should also mention that the names of the colleges should be capitalized, but the user's question is about grammaticality, not capitalization. However, if the user is interested in full correctness, that's a separate issue, but the main focus here is subject-verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""The institutions of higher learning""** (plural).  
- The verb must agree in number with the subject.  
  - Sentence A uses **""include""** (plural verb), which correctly matches the plural subject.  
  - Sentence B incorrectly uses **""includes""** (singular verb), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

**Note:** Both sentences have capitalization errors (e.g., ""clayton state university"" should be ""Clayton State University""), but the core grammatical issue here is **subject-verb agreement**."
10,include,includes,3,"The institutions of higher learning with a presence on campus include clayton state university, gordon state college and southern crescent technical college.","The institutions of higher learning with a presence on campus includes clayton state university, gordon state college and southern crescent technical college.",22,3392,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb: ""includes"" in A and ""include"" in B.

First, I need to identify the subject of each sentence. The subject is ""The institutions of higher learning with a presence on campus."" The key word here is ""institutions,"" which is plural. 

So, the verb needs to agree with the subject in number. Since ""institutions"" is plural, the verb should be plural as well. The plural form of the verb is ""include,"" whereas ""includes"" is singular. 

Looking at Sentence A: ""includes"" is singular, but the subject is plural. That's a subject-verb agreement error. Sentence B uses ""include,"" which matches the plural subject. Therefore, Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect.

Wait, let me double-check. Sometimes prepositional phrases can confuse the subject. The phrase here is ""with a presence on campus."" But that's modifying ""institutions,"" so the subject is still ""institutions."" Yep, definitely plural. So the verb should be ""include."" 

Another thing to check: the list of colleges. The sentence lists multiple colleges, which reinforces that the subject is plural. So ""include"" is correct. Sentence B is grammatical, and A is not. Also, the proper nouns like Clayton State University should be capitalized, but the user's question is about grammaticality, not capitalization. So even if the names are lowercase in the sentences, the main issue is subject-verb agreement. So the answer remains the same.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""The institutions of higher learning"" (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb ""**includes**"" with a plural subject.  
- Sentence B correctly uses the plural verb ""**include**"" to match the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement.  
**Note:** Proper nouns (e.g., ""Clayton State University"") should also be capitalized, but this does not affect the grammaticality judgment here."

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb: ""shows"" in A and ""show"" in B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""A look through several generations of clerics in seminaries."" The core of the subject is ""A look,"" which is singular. The verb should agree with the subject in number. So, a singular subject takes a singular verb. ""Shows"" is singular, and ""show"" is plural. Therefore, sentence A uses the correct singular verb, making it grammatical. Sentence B uses the plural verb, which doesn't agree with the singular subject, so it's ungrammatical.

Wait, but sometimes prepositional phrases can confuse things. The phrase ""through several generations..."" might make someone think the subject is plural, but actually, the subject is still ""A look."" The prepositional phrase just adds more information but doesn't change the number of the subject. So even though ""generations"" is plural, the verb still needs to agree with ""look,"" which is singular. 

Let me check examples. ""A book on the shelves is missing."" Here, ""book"" is singular, so ""is"" is correct, even though ""shelves"" is plural. Similarly, ""A list of items needs to be prepared."" The subject is ""list,"" so ""needs"" is correct. So yes, the verb agrees with the main noun in the subject, not the objects of prepositions. 

Therefore, sentence A is correct because ""a look"" is singular and takes ""shows."" Sentence B is incorrect because it uses ""show,"" which is plural. The user might be confused because of the plural noun ""generations,"" but the key is identifying the actual subject of the sentence. 

Another way to test is to remove the prepositional phrases: ""A look... shows..."" which clearly is correct. If the subject were plural, like ""Looks through... show,"" then ""show"" would be correct. But since it's ""a look,"" singular, the verb must be singular. 

So the answer is that Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical due to subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of both sentences is **""A look""** (singular). The verb must agree with the singular subject, so **""shows""** (singular) is correct. Sentence B incorrectly uses **""show""** (plural), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

**Key Rule:**  
Prepositional phrases like *""through several generations of clerics in seminaries""* do not affect the verb’s number. The verb always agrees with the grammatical subject (**""A look""**)."
9,shows,show,3,A look through several generations of clerics in seminaries shows significant differences in viewpoints and practical approaches.,A look through several generations of clerics in seminaries show significant differences in viewpoints and practical approaches.,17,3886,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb: ""show"" vs. ""shows"". 

First, I need to figure out the subject of each sentence. The subject in both cases is ""A look through several generations of clerics in seminaries"". That's a noun phrase starting with ""A look"". The verb needs to agree with the subject in number. 

Since the subject is ""A look"", which is singular (because ""a"" is an indefinite article for singular nouns), the verb should be singular as well. So, ""shows"" would be correct because it's the third person singular form. ""Show"" is the plural form, which wouldn't agree with a singular subject.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come after the subject. Like, if there's a prepositional phrase, especially one that includes a plural noun, they might think the verb should agree with that. In this case, ""through several generations..."" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""look"". The key here is that the subject is still ""A look"", not ""generations"" or ""clerics"". So the verb should still be singular.

So Sentence A uses ""show"", which is plural, but the subject is singular. That makes Sentence A incorrect. Sentence B uses ""shows"", which is singular, so that's correct. 

I should also check if there's anything else that might affect this. For example, sometimes collective nouns can be tricky, but ""a look"" isn't a collective noun. It's a singular noun. So yeah, the verb must agree with ""a look"", hence ""shows"" is right. 

Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of both sentences is the singular noun phrase *""A look through several generations of clerics in seminaries.""* The verb must agree with the singular subject *""A look""* (third-person singular).  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses the plural verb *""show""* (✗).  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses the singular verb *""shows""* (✓).  

The intervening prepositional phrase (*""through several generations...""*) does not affect subject-verb agreement. The core subject (*""A look""*) remains singular."

Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, and the difference between them is the verb ""shows"" versus ""show"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, I should identify the subject in each sentence.

Looking at Sentence A: ""My search through pages and pages of matching archives shows it..."" The subject here is ""My search."" The phrase ""through pages and pages of matching archives"" is a prepositional phrase modifying the subject. The verb is ""shows."" Since ""search"" is singular, the verb should be singular as well. So ""shows"" would be correct here.

Sentence B uses ""show"" instead. If the subject were plural, like ""searches,"" then ""show"" would be correct. But since the subject is ""search,"" which is singular, ""show"" would be incorrect. Therefore, Sentence B is ungrammatical because the verb doesn't agree with the singular subject.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come between the subject and verb. For example, if the subject is followed by a prepositional phrase with a plural noun, like ""pages and pages,"" they might mistakenly make the verb plural. But the rule is that the verb agrees with the subject, not the object of the preposition. So in this case, ""search"" is still singular, so ""shows"" is correct.

So, Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is not. Let me double-check. Yes, ""My search... shows"" is correct. The intervening phrases don't change the subject's number. So the answer should be that Sentence A is correct and B is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""My search""** (singular), so the verb must agree in number. The phrase *""through pages and pages of matching archives""* is a prepositional phrase modifying the subject but does not affect the verb's number.  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""shows""** (singular verb) to match the singular subject *""search.""*  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""show""** (plural verb), which clashes with the singular subject.  

**Key Rule:** The verb must agree with the **subject** (not intervening phrases)."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both very similar except for the verb ""show"" vs. ""shows"". 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, I need to identify the subject in each sentence.

Looking at both sentences, the main subject is ""My search"". The phrase ""through pages and pages of matching archives"" is a prepositional phrase modifying the subject. Prepositional phrases don't affect the verb number. So the core subject is ""search"", which is singular. 

Therefore, the verb should agree with the singular subject. ""Search shows"" would be correct because ""shows"" is the third person singular form. Sentence B uses ""shows"", so that should be correct. Sentence A uses ""show"", which is plural, so that would be incorrect because the subject is singular. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with intervening phrases. For example, if the subject were ""pages"", which is plural, then ""show"" would be correct. But in this case, ""pages and pages"" is part of the prepositional phrase starting with ""through"", so the subject remains ""search"". 

Another way to check is to remove the prepositional phrase: ""My search show it..."" vs. ""My search shows it..."". Clearly, ""shows"" is correct here. So sentence B is grammatical, and A is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""My search""** (singular), and the verb must agree in number. The prepositional phrase *""through pages and pages of matching archives""* does not affect the verb's conjugation. Since ""search"" is singular, the correct verb form is **""shows""** (Sentence B).  

Sentence A incorrectly uses **""show""** (plural verb), which clashes with the singular subject.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Ignore intervening phrases between the subject and verb when determining agreement. Focus on the core subject (""search"") to choose the correct verb form."

Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are about poems reminding us of transparent watches where the movements and direction of each gear and lever are visible (Sentence A) versus using ""is"" instead of ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to figure out the subject-verb agreement here. The key part is the relative clause starting with ""where."" The subject in that clause is ""the movements and direction of each gear and lever."" So, the verb should agree with this compound subject.

Compound subjects connected by ""and"" usually take a plural verb. So, ""movements and direction"" are two things, even though ""direction"" is singular. But wait, ""movements"" is plural and ""direction"" is singular. When you have a compound subject with ""and,"" even if one part is singular and the other plural, the verb should be plural. For example, ""The cat and the dogs are playing."" So, ""are"" would be correct here.

But sometimes, if the compound subject is considered a single unit, it might take a singular verb. However, in this case, ""movements"" and ""direction"" are two separate aspects. The gears and levers have both movements (which are plural) and a direction (singular). So together, they form a plural subject. Therefore, the verb should be ""are,"" making Sentence A correct and Sentence B incorrect.

Wait, but maybe someone could argue that ""each gear and lever"" is singular? Let me check. The phrase ""each gear and lever"" uses ""each,"" which makes each noun singular. So ""each gear"" and ""each lever"" are both singular. But the subject of the verb is ""movements and direction,"" not ""each gear and lever."" The ""of each gear and lever"" is a prepositional phrase modifying the subject. So the main subject is ""movements and direction,"" which is plural. Therefore, the verb should be ""are.""

So Sentence A is grammatical because it uses ""are,"" and Sentence B is ungrammatical with ""is."" That makes sense. I should also consider if there's any exception or other rule I'm missing. For example, sometimes when the parts of the subject are abstract or considered a single idea, a singular verb might be used. But ""movements"" and ""direction"" are two distinct concepts here. They aren't a single entity, so plural is correct. Yeah, I think that's right. So the answer is Sentence A is correct, Sentence B is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the clause is *""the movements and direction of each gear and lever,""* which is a compound subject joined by *""and.""* Even though *""direction""* is singular, the combination of *""movements""* (plural) and *""direction""* (singular) creates a plural subject, requiring the plural verb **""are""** (as in Sentence A).  

Sentence B incorrectly uses the singular verb **""is,""** which does not agree with the plural compound subject. The phrase *""of each gear and lever""* modifies the subject but does not affect the verb agreement.  

**Key Rule:**  
Compound subjects joined by *""and""* typically take a plural verb, even if individual parts are singular."

Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are almost identical except for the verb at the end—""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to figure out the subject that the verb is agreeing with. The part in question is ""the movements and direction of each gear and lever."" The verb here is either ""is"" or ""are."" 

The subject here is a compound noun phrase: ""movements and direction."" Even though ""each gear and lever"" follows, that's part of a prepositional phrase (""of each gear and lever"") modifying the subject. So the main subject is ""movements and direction,"" which is plural because it's two things joined by ""and."" 

In English, when you have a compound subject joined by ""and,"" it usually takes a plural verb. So the correct verb should be ""are"" instead of ""is."" That would make Sentence B correct. 

Wait, but sometimes when the compound subject is considered a single unit, it might take a singular verb. For example, ""peanut butter and jelly is my favorite sandwich."" But in this case, ""movements and direction"" are two distinct aspects, so they should be treated as plural. 

Another angle: maybe the user is confused because ""each gear and lever"" is singular. But ""each"" is a distributive adjective, meaning it applies to both ""gear"" and ""lever"" individually. However, the subject is still ""movements and direction,"" which is separate from the ""each"" part. 

So, the verb needs to agree with the plural subject ""movements and direction,"" hence ""are"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The verb (is/are) must agree with the compound subject **""the movements and direction""**. Since ""movements and direction"" are two distinct elements joined by *and*, the subject is plural. Thus, the plural verb **""are""** (Sentence B) is correct.  

In Sentence A, **""is""** incorrectly treats the plural subject as singular. Even though ""each gear and lever"" follows, it is part of a prepositional phrase modifying the subject and does not affect verb agreement.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
Compound subjects joined by *and* typically require a plural verb."
18,is,are,3,"The table below lists scores for flat horses only starting with the highest, rated at 147 which is the british horse frankel.","The table below lists scores for flat horses only starting with the highest, rated at 147 which are the british horse frankel.",22,4324,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about a table listing scores for flat horses, starting with the highest rated, which is Frankel, a British horse.

First, I need to look at the key difference between the two sentences. Both are almost identical except for the verb used in the relative clause. Sentence A uses ""is"" (""rated at 147 which is the British horse Frankel""), while Sentence B uses ""are"" (""rated at 147 which are the British horse Frankel"").

The main subject here is ""the British horse Frankel."" Since Frankel is a singular noun—a specific horse—the verb should agree with a singular subject. ""Is"" is singular, and ""are"" is plural. So, ""which is"" would be correct because it refers back to the singular noun ""horse Frankel.""

Wait, but let me check the structure again. The relative clause ""which is/are the British horse Frankel"" is modifying ""147."" The rating of 147 is being linked to Frankel. So, the antecedent of ""which"" is ""147,"" but actually, the rating is associated with the horse. Hmm, maybe the structure is that the horse is rated at 147. So the clause ""rated at 147"" is describing the horse. Then ""which"" refers to the horse, not the number. Wait, the sentence structure is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.

Original sentence structure: ""starting with the highest, rated at 147 which is/are the British horse Frankel."" The highest-rated horse is Frankel, who has a rating of 147. So the relative clause ""which is/are..."" is describing the horse that's rated at 147. But the way the sentence is structured, ""rated at 147"" is a participle phrase modifying ""the highest."" Then ""which"" introduces a relative clause that further describes the horse. So ""the highest [horse], rated at 147, which is the British horse Frankel."" Here, ""which"" refers to the horse, which is singular. Therefore, the correct verb should be ""is."" 

In Sentence B, using ""are"" would be incorrect because it's plural, but the subject (Frankel) is singular. So Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is ungrammatical due to subject-verb agreement error.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The key difference lies in the verb agreement within the relative clause:  
- **Sentence A** uses *""which is""* to refer to *""the British horse Frankel""* (singular). Since ""Frankel"" is a singular noun, the singular verb *""is""* correctly matches the subject.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses *""which are""* (plural) to refer to the singular noun *""the British horse Frankel""*. This mismatch in subject-verb agreement makes the sentence ungrammatical.  

**Additional Note:**  
The phrasing of both sentences is somewhat awkward due to missing commas and unclear structure. A more polished version might read:  
*""The table below lists scores for flat horses only, starting with the highest-rated British horse, Frankel, at 147.""*"
18,is,are,3,"The table below lists scores for flat horses only starting with the highest, rated at 147 which is the british horse frankel.","The table below lists scores for flat horses only starting with the highest, rated at 147 which are the british horse frankel.",22,4324,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about a table listing scores for flat horses, starting with the highest rated at 147, which refers to the British horse Frankel.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used in the relative clause: Sentence A uses ""are"" and Sentence B uses ""is"". The relative clause is ""which are the British horse Frankel"" vs. ""which is the British horse Frankel"".

The key here is subject-verb agreement. The relative pronoun ""which"" refers back to a noun. In both sentences, the noun that ""which"" is referring to is important. Let's parse the sentences.

Looking at Sentence A: ""The table below lists scores for flat horses only starting with the highest, rated at 147 which are the British horse Frankel."" The part after 147 is a relative clause modifying ""the highest"" (which I assume is short for ""the highest-rated horse""). So, ""the highest"" is singular because it's the highest-rated horse. Therefore, the relative clause should agree in number. If ""the highest"" is singular, then ""which"" refers to a singular noun, so the verb should be ""is"". But Sentence A uses ""are"", which is plural. That would be incorrect because the subject is singular. 

Sentence B: ""...rated at 147 which is the British horse Frankel."" Here, ""is"" is singular, matching the singular noun ""the highest-rated horse"". So that would be correct. 

Wait, but maybe I need to check if ""which"" refers to ""scores"" or ""147"" instead. Let me look again. The structure is ""scores for flat horses only starting with the highest, rated at 147 which..."" So ""starting with the highest"" probably refers to the highest score, and ""rated at 147"" describes that score. Then ""which"" could refer to the score. But a score being a horse doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe ""the highest"" refers to the horse. So ""the highest-rated horse"", which is rated at 147. Then ""which"" refers to the horse, so ""the British horse Frankel"". In that case, ""which"" would be singular, so ""is"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is correct because ""which"" refers to the singular noun (the horse), and Sentence A incorrectly uses ""are"" with a singular subject.

Another angle: Maybe the user intended ""147"" as the antecedent for ""which"". But 147 is a number, so ""which is the British horse Frankel"" would be incorrect because a number can't be a horse. So that doesn't make sense. Therefore, ""which"" must refer to the horse, which is singular. Hence, ""is"" is correct. So Sentence B is grammatical, and A is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The critical difference lies in the verb agreement within the relative clause:  
- **Sentence A** uses *""which are the British horse Frankel""* (plural verb *""are""*).  
- **Sentence B** uses *""which is the British horse Frankel""* (singular verb *""is""*).  

The relative pronoun **""which""** refers back to the singular noun phrase **""the highest [horse]""** (implied by context). Since the antecedent is singular, the verb must also be singular (**""is""**).  

### Why Sentence A is incorrect:  
Using *""are""* (plural) incorrectly suggests that ""which"" refers to multiple entities (e.g., ""scores"" or ""horses""), but the context clearly identifies a single horse, Frankel, rated at 147.  

### Why Sentence B is correct:  
The singular verb *""is""* properly agrees with the singular antecedent (the highest-rated horse, Frankel).  

**Note:** The sentence could be further improved for clarity (e.g., punctuation and phrasing), but the core grammatical issue is resolved in Sentence B."
17,is,are,3,"For seabirds, the location of colonies on islands, which are inaccessible to terrestrial predators, is an obvious advantage.","For seabirds, the location of colonies on islands, which are inaccessible to terrestrial predators, are an obvious advantage.",18,4414,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Both look pretty similar except for the verb at the end: ""is"" in A and ""are"" in B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The main clause here is about the location of colonies being an advantage. The subject is ""the location of colonies on islands,"" right? The part between commas is a relative clause modifying ""islands,"" saying they're inaccessible to predators. So the core sentence is ""For seabirds, the location [...] is an obvious advantage.""

Now, the key is subject-verb agreement. The subject is ""location,"" which is singular. So the verb should agree with a singular subject. That would be ""is"" in sentence A. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is plural. That doesn't match the singular subject ""location,"" so B is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe someone could think the subject is ""colonies"" because it's closer to the verb? Let me check. The main clause structure: ""the location [...] is an advantage."" The phrase ""of colonies on islands"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""location."" So the head noun is ""location,"" which is singular. The relative clause ""which are inaccessible..."" refers to ""islands,"" which is plural, but that's in the relative clause, not the main clause. So the verb in the main clause should still agree with ""location.""

Therefore, sentence A is correct because ""is"" matches the singular subject ""location,"" and sentence B is wrong because ""are"" is plural. Got it. Let me make sure there's no other possible confusion. Maybe someone might think ""colonies"" is the subject, but no, the structure clearly shows ""location"" as the main subject. Yep, that's right. So the answer is A is grammatical, B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The subject of the main clause is **""the location of colonies on islands""**, which is singular (""location"" is the head noun). The verb must agree with this singular subject:  
- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""is""** (singular verb).  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""are""** (plural verb), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

The relative clause **""which are inaccessible to terrestrial predators""** modifies **""islands""** (plural), but this does not affect the main clause’s subject-verb agreement. The core sentence structure is:  
*""The location [...] **is** an obvious advantage.""*  

Thus, **Sentence A** is correct, and **Sentence B** is ungrammatical."
17,is,are,3,"For seabirds, the location of colonies on islands, which are inaccessible to terrestrial predators, is an obvious advantage.","For seabirds, the location of colonies on islands, which are inaccessible to terrestrial predators, are an obvious advantage.",18,4414,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are about seabirds and the location of their colonies. The main difference between them is the verb ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The subject is crucial because the verb must agree with it in number. Let's break down Sentence A: ""For seabirds, the location of colonies on islands, which are inaccessible to terrestrial predators, are an obvious advantage."" The main clause here is ""the location... are an obvious advantage."" The subject is ""the location,"" which is singular. The verb should be ""is"" to agree with a singular subject. But Sentence A uses ""are,"" which is plural. That seems incorrect. 

Then there's the relative clause: ""which are inaccessible to terrestrial predators."" The ""which"" here refers to ""islands,"" since that's the nearest noun. ""Islands"" are plural, so ""are"" is correct in the relative clause. But that doesn't affect the main verb. The main clause's subject is still ""location,"" so the verb should be ""is."" Therefore, Sentence B, which uses ""is,"" should be correct. 

Wait, let me double-check. Sometimes these sentences can be tricky with intervening phrases. The phrase ""of colonies on islands"" is part of the subject, but the head noun is ""location,"" which is singular. Even though ""colonies"" is plural, the main subject remains ""location."" So the verb must agree with ""location,"" hence ""is."" 

So Sentence A is wrong because it uses ""are,"" which doesn't agree with the singular subject. Sentence B is correct because it uses ""is."" The relative clause about the islands being inaccessible is just extra information and doesn't change the subject-verb agreement in the main clause. 

Another way to test this is to simplify the sentence. Remove the relative clause and the prepositional phrases: ""The location is an obvious advantage."" That makes sense. If you said ""The location are an obvious advantage,"" that's clearly wrong. So yes, Sentence B is correct.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the main clause is **""the location""** (singular), so the verb must agree in number: **""is""** (singular) is correct.  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses **""are""** (plural), which mistakenly agrees with the plural noun **""colonies""** or **""islands""** in the modifying clause.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses **""is""** to match the singular subject **""location.""**  

The phrase **""which are inaccessible to terrestrial predators""** is a non-essential clause modifying **""islands""** and does not affect the subject-verb agreement in the main clause.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Always identify the **main subject** of the sentence (here, *""the location""*) and ensure the verb agrees with it, ignoring intervening phrases."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to identify the subject of the verb. The sentence structure is a bit complex. The main clause is ""The merits... are/is irrelevant..."" The subject here is ""merits,"" which is plural. So the verb should agree with ""merits."" 

Looking at Sentence A: ""The merits... are irrelevant..."" That seems correct because ""are"" is plural, matching ""merits."" 

Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is singular. That would be incorrect because ""merits"" is plural. But wait, maybe there's a complicating factor. The phrase ""such as being an academic, peer-reviewed journal"" is a parenthetical example. Sometimes parentheticals can confuse subject-verb agreement.

But in this case, the subject is still ""merits,"" not the example given. The examples introduced by ""such as"" don't change the number of the subject. So even though the example is singular (""being an academic journal""), the main subject remains plural. Therefore, the verb should be plural ""are."" 

Another thing to check: sometimes when the subject is followed by a prepositional phrase, the verb agrees with the subject, not the object of the preposition. Here, ""of the article subject"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""merits,"" so the verb still needs to agree with ""merits."" 

So Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect because it uses ""is"" instead of ""are."" The user might be confused because the example given in the ""such as"" phrase is singular, but that doesn't affect the verb agreement. The key is to focus on the main subject, which is ""merits.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""The merits""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number. Sentence A correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb), while Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb).  

The phrase **""such as being an academic, peer-reviewed journal""** is a parenthetical example and does not affect the grammatical number of the subject. The core structure is:  
*The merits [...] **are** irrelevant.*  

Thus, **Sentence B** violates subject-verb agreement."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about the merits of an article subject. The main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The subject here is ""The merits of the article subject."" The word ""merits"" is plural, so the verb should agree with that. But wait, sometimes even if the subject seems plural, if it's considered a single concept, it might take a singular verb. Let me think. ""Merits"" here refers to the positive qualities or aspects, so it's plural. Therefore, the verb should be plural as well. 

Looking at Sentence A: ""...merits... is irrelevant..."" That uses a singular verb ""is"" with a plural subject ""merits."" That seems incorrect. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is plural, so that should be correct. 

But wait, there's a phrase in the middle: ""such as being an academic, peer-reviewed journal."" This is an appositive phrase giving examples of the merits. The subject is still ""merits,"" so the verb must agree with that. The intervening phrase doesn't change the number of the subject. So the verb should definitely be ""are."" 

Another thing to check: sometimes people get confused with collective nouns or when the subject is separated by phrases. But in this case, ""merits"" is clearly plural. So Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""The merits""* (plural), so the verb must agree in number. Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb *""is""* with the plural subject *""merits.""* Sentence B correctly uses the plural verb *""are.""*  

The intervening phrase *""such as being an academic, peer-reviewed journal""* does not affect subject-verb agreement. The core structure remains:  
- **The merits** (plural subject) **→ are** (plural verb).  

Thus, **Sentence B** is correct."
8,remain,remains,3,"However, the issues of cost versus benefit remain an area of ongoing research and discussion.","However, the issues of cost versus benefit remains an area of ongoing research and discussion.",15,5114,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both starting with ""However, the issues of cost versus benefit..."" and then differing in the verb: ""remain"" vs. ""remains"". 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The main clause is ""the issues... remain/remains an area..."" The subject here is ""the issues"". ""Of cost versus benefit"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""issues"". So the subject is plural because ""issues"" is plural.

In English, the verb must agree with the subject in number. Plural subjects take plural verbs, and singular subjects take singular verbs. The verb in question is ""remain"" (plural) vs. ""remains"" (singular). Since the subject ""issues"" is plural, the correct verb should be ""remain"". Therefore, Sentence A uses ""remain"", which is correct, and Sentence B uses ""remains"", which is incorrect because it's singular.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come between the subject and verb. For example, if the subject was ""the issue"", then ""remains"" would be correct. But here it's ""issues"", so the verb should definitely be plural. Let me double-check. Yes, ""the issues... remain"". So Sentence A is correct, Sentence B is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""the issues""** (plural).  
- The verb must agree in number with the subject.  
  - Sentence A uses **""remain""** (plural verb), which correctly matches the plural subject.  
  - Sentence B incorrectly uses **""remains""** (singular verb), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

**Key Tip:** Ignore prepositional phrases like *""of cost versus benefit""* when determining subject-verb agreement. Focus on the core subject (**""issues""**) to choose the correct verb form."
8,remain,remains,3,"However, the issues of cost versus benefit remain an area of ongoing research and discussion.","However, the issues of cost versus benefit remains an area of ongoing research and discussion.",15,5114,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Both are very similar except for the verb: ""remains"" in A and ""remain"" in B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of each sentence. The main clause in both is ""the issues of cost versus benefit [remains/remain] an area..."" The subject here is ""the issues."" The phrase ""of cost versus benefit"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""issues."" 

Now, the key is subject-verb agreement. The verb must agree with the subject in number. ""Issues"" is plural, so the verb should be plural as well. ""Remain"" is the plural form, while ""remains"" is singular. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused because of the prepositional phrase. They might think the verb should agree with ""cost versus benefit,"" but that's part of the prepositional phrase and not the subject. The actual subject is ""issues,"" which is plural. So the correct verb should be ""remain."" 

Therefore, Sentence B uses ""remain,"" which matches the plural subject ""issues,"" making it correct. Sentence A uses ""remains,"" which is singular, so it's incorrect. 

I should also check if there's any other possible confusion. Maybe someone might think ""cost versus benefit"" is the subject, but no, the structure is ""the issues of [something]."" The main noun is ""issues."" So yeah, definitely Sentence B is correct.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""the issues""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number. The correct plural verb form is **""remain""** (Sentence B). Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb **""remains""**, which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Key Detail:**  
The phrase **""of cost versus benefit""** is a prepositional phrase modifying the subject but does not affect subject-verb agreement. The core subject (""issues"") determines the verb form."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. Both start with ""Many vocalists, in today's metal scene, use..."" but sentence B has ""uses"" instead of ""use"". 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that the verb must agree with the subject in number. So if the subject is plural, the verb should be plural, and if the subject is singular, the verb should be singular.

Looking at both sentences, the subject is ""Many vocalists"". ""Many"" indicates a plural noun, so ""vocalists"" is plural. Therefore, the verb should be plural. The verb in question is ""use"" or ""uses"". ""Use"" is the plural form, and ""uses"" is singular. 

Sentence A uses ""use"", which matches the plural subject ""vocalists"". Sentence B uses ""uses"", which is singular, so it doesn't agree with the plural subject. That makes sentence B incorrect. 

I should also check if there's anything else that might affect the subject-verb agreement. The phrase ""in today's metal scene"" is set off by commas, acting as a parenthetical element. That means it doesn't affect the subject-verb agreement. The core of the sentence is still ""Many vocalists use..."". 

Another thing to consider: sometimes with intervening phrases, people might get confused about the subject. For example, if the sentence was ""A vocalist, along with others, uses..."" then ""a vocalist"" is singular, so ""uses"" would be correct. But here, the subject is clearly plural, so ""use"" is right. 

So, sentence A is correct, sentence B is incorrect because of the singular verb with a plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Many vocalists""** (plural). The verb must agree with the subject in number.  
- Sentence A correctly uses **""use""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""uses""** (singular verb), which clashes with the plural subject.  

The parenthetical phrase *""in today's metal scene""* does not affect subject-verb agreement. The core structure is:  
*Many vocalists [...] **use** [...] methods.*"
9,use,uses,3,"Many vocalists, in today's metal scene, use two or more methods of singing and vocalizing lyrics.","Many vocalists, in today's metal scene, uses two or more methods of singing and vocalizing lyrics.",16,5384,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: Sentence A or Sentence B. Both sentences are similar except for the verb ""uses"" in A and ""use"" in B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, the key here is to identify the subject in each sentence and check if the verb agrees with it.

Looking at both sentences, the main clause is ""Many vocalists [...] use/uses two or more methods..."" The subject here is ""Many vocalists."" The phrase ""in today's metal scene"" is set off by commas, which means it's a parenthetical element or an appositive. That part can be removed without changing the core meaning of the sentence. So if I take that out, the sentence becomes ""Many vocalists use/uses two or more methods...""

Now, ""many vocalists"" is a plural subject. ""Many"" indicates more than one, so the noun ""vocalists"" is plural. Therefore, the verb should also be plural. The plural form of the verb is ""use,"" while ""uses"" is singular. 

So in Sentence A, the verb is ""uses,"" which is singular, but the subject is plural. That's a disagreement. Sentence B uses ""use,"" which is plural, matching the plural subject. Therefore, Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect because of the subject-verb disagreement.

Wait, let me double-check. Sometimes, phrases between commas can be confusing. But in this case, the subject is definitely ""Many vocalists,"" and the verb comes after the parenthetical phrase. The parenthetical doesn't affect the subject-verb agreement. So yes, the verb should agree with ""vocalists,"" which is plural. So ""use"" is correct. 

Another way to test is to simplify the sentence. Remove the parenthetical: ""Many vocalists use two or more methods..."" That sounds right. If it were a singular subject, like ""A vocalist uses...,"" then ""uses"" would be correct. But here, it's plural. So Sentence B is grammatical, and A is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Many vocalists""** (plural). The verb must agree in number with the subject.  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb **""uses""** with a plural subject.  
- Sentence B correctly uses the plural verb **""use""** to match the plural subject **""vocalists""**.  

The parenthetical phrase *""in today's metal scene""* does not affect subject-verb agreement. When removed, the core structure becomes clear:  
- *""Many vocalists [...] use two or more methods...""* (correct).  
- *""Many vocalists [...] uses...""* (incorrect).  

**Key Rule:** Plural subjects require plural verbs."

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Let me read them again carefully.

Sentence A: ""Opponents of the practice claim that all except those who joined of their own volition are virtually slaves in every normal sense of the word.""

Sentence B: ""Opponents of the practice claim that all except those who joined of their own volition is virtually slaves in every normal sense of the word.""

Hmm, the main difference between the two is the verb used: ""are"" in A and ""is"" in B. The subject here is ""all except those who joined of their own volition."" I need to determine whether the verb should be plural or singular.

First, let's break down the subject. The phrase ""all except those who joined..."" Here, ""all"" is a pronoun. When ""all"" refers to a group of people, it's usually considered plural. For example, ""All are welcome."" But sometimes ""all"" can be singular if it refers to a singular noun, like ""All the cake is gone."" But in this case, ""all"" is referring to people except a certain group. So ""all"" here is plural because it's talking about multiple people.

The structure is ""all except those..."" which is similar to ""all (people) except those..."" So the subject is plural. Therefore, the verb should agree with the plural subject. ""Are"" is plural, and ""is"" is singular. So sentence A uses ""are,"" which is correct, and sentence B uses ""is,"" which is incorrect.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes with ""all,"" it can be tricky. If ""all"" is followed by a prepositional phrase, does that affect the verb? For example, ""All of the students are here."" But here it's ""all except those..."" So ""except those..."" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""all."" The basic rule is that the verb agrees with the subject, not the object of the preposition. So even though ""except those..."" is there, the subject is still ""all,"" which is plural. Therefore, ""are"" is correct.

Another way to test: remove the prepositional phrase. ""All are virtually slaves..."" That makes sense. If you take out ""except those who joined..."", the sentence would be ""Opponents claim that all are virtually slaves..."" which is correct. If you use ""is"" there, it would be ""all is virtually slaves,"" which is clearly wrong because ""all"" is plural here.

So sentence B is incorrect because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject. Therefore, sentence A is grammatical, and sentence B is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A is grammatical.**  
- **Sentence B is ungrammatical.**  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the clause is *""all except those who joined of their own volition.""* Here, **""all""** refers to a plural group (people), so the verb must agree with the plural subject.  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
Verbs must agree in number with their subjects. When ""all"" refers to a plural entity, it requires a plural verb."

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about opponents claiming that everyone except those who joined voluntarily are virtually slaves.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B. The subject here is ""all except those who joined of their own volition."" 

Hmm, subject-verb agreement is key here. The verb must agree with the subject in number. The phrase ""all except those..."" – what's the subject here? ""All"" is a pronoun that can be singular or plural depending on context. In this case, ""all"" refers to people (since we're talking about opponents and slaves), so it's plural. The exception is ""those who joined..."" which is a plural noun phrase. So ""all except those..."" would mean ""all people except those people,"" so the remaining group is still plural. Therefore, the verb should be plural as well. 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""is,"" which is singular. That doesn't agree with the plural subject. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is plural, so that should be correct. 

Wait, let me double-check. The structure is ""all [except...] are..."" because ""all"" here is referring to multiple people. The exception doesn't change the fact that the subject is plural. For example, ""All students except John are present."" Here, ""are"" is correct because ""students"" is plural. Similarly, in the given sentences, ""all"" (referring to people) except some others should take ""are."" So Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect because it uses ""is"" instead of ""are.""

Another thing to check: the rest of the sentence. The phrase ""virtually slaves in every normal sense of the word"" – ""slaves"" is plural, which also supports that the subject should be plural, hence ""are."" 

So, conclusion: Sentence B is grammatical, Sentence A is ungrammatical due to subject-verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the clause is *""all except those who joined of their own volition""*. Here, *""all""* refers to a plural group (people), and the exception (*""those who joined...""*) does not change the plural nature of the subject. Thus, the verb must agree with the plural subject, requiring **""are""** (plural) instead of **""is""** (singular).  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular), violating subject-verb agreement.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses **""are""** (plural), matching the plural subject.  

The error in Sentence A makes it ungrammatical."
12,continue,continues,3,Matriarchal interpretations of the archaeological record and the criticism of such work continue to be matters of academic debate.,Matriarchal interpretations of the archaeological record and the criticism of such work continues to be matters of academic debate.,19,5426,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. Both sentences are almost identical except for the verb ""continue"" vs. ""continues."" The subject in both cases is ""Matriarchal interpretations... and the criticism of such work."" 

First, I need to figure out if the subject is singular or plural. The subject here is a compound subject because it's connected by ""and."" That usually makes it plural. For example, ""apples and oranges are fruits."" So, if the subject is plural, the verb should agree in number. In sentence A, the verb is ""continue,"" which is plural. In sentence B, it's ""continues,"" which is singular.

Wait, but sometimes when you have two singular nouns connected by ""and,"" the verb becomes plural. So, ""interpretations"" is plural, and ""criticism"" is singular. Wait, no, ""Matriarchal interpretations"" is plural, and ""the criticism"" is singular. So the compound subject is plural + singular. But when you connect them with ""and,"" the whole subject becomes plural. So the verb should be plural. Therefore, sentence A is correct because ""continue"" is plural, matching the compound subject. Sentence B uses ""continues,"" which is singular, so it's incorrect.

But let me double-check. Maybe there's a case where the compound subject is considered singular. But I don't think so. Unless the two parts are considered a single unit. For example, ""peanut butter and jelly is my favorite sandwich."" But in this case, ""interpretations"" and ""criticism"" are separate things. They're two different aspects, so they form a plural subject. Therefore, ""continue"" is correct. So sentence A is grammatical, and B is ungrammatical.

Another way to test is to break it down. If I take each part of the subject:

1. Matriarchal interpretations... continue...
2. The criticism... continues...

But since they're connected by ""and,"" the verb should agree with both. So plural. So ""continue"" is right. Therefore, sentence A is correct.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is a compound plural subject:  
- *Matriarchal interpretations of the archaeological record* (plural)  
- *the criticism of such work* (singular)  

When joined by ""and,"" compound subjects typically require a **plural verb** (e.g., *continue*). Sentence A correctly uses the plural verb **""continue""** to agree with the combined subjects.  

Sentence B incorrectly uses the singular verb **""continues""**, which does not match the plural nature of the compound subject.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
Compound subjects joined by *and* generally take a plural verb, even if one part of the subject is singular."

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both talking about matriarchal interpretations and their criticism being matters of academic debate. The difference between them is the verb: ""continues"" in A and ""continue"" in B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The subject is a compound one: ""Matriarchal interpretations... and the criticism of such work."" When you have a compound subject joined by ""and,"" it's usually plural. So, the verb should agree with a plural subject. That means the verb should be ""continue"" instead of ""continues."" 

Wait, but maybe there's an exception? Like if the two parts of the subject are considered a single idea. For example, ""peanut butter and jelly is my favorite sandwich."" But in this case, the two parts are separate: interpretations and criticism. They're two different things, so they should be treated as plural. 

So sentence A uses ""continues,"" which is singular, but the subject is plural. That makes sentence A incorrect. Sentence B uses ""continue,"" which is plural, so that should be correct. 

Let me double-check. If I simplify the sentence: ""Interpretations and criticism continue..."" Yes, that sounds right. If it were ""each interpretation and criticism continues,"" then maybe ""continues"" would work, but here it's a compound subject without ""each"" or ""every."" 

Another way to test: replace the compound subject with ""they."" ""They continue to be matters..."" That works. If I used ""it,"" ""It continues..."" but the subject isn't singular. So definitely, sentence B is correct, and A is incorrect because of subject-verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is a compound plural: *""Matriarchal interpretations ... and the criticism of such work.""* When two or more subjects are joined by *""and,""* they typically require a plural verb (**continue**). Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb *""continues,""* which does not agree with the plural subject. Sentence B correctly uses the plural verb *""continue.""*  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
Compound subjects joined by *""and""* generally take a plural verb."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are similar except for the verb used: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B. The subject here is ""the only places that connect the vulture and the shark story,"" so I need to determine if the verb should agree with a singular or plural subject.

First, I'll look at the subject. The main noun is ""places,"" which is plural. The phrase ""that connect the vulture and the shark story"" is a relative clause modifying ""places."" So the subject of the sentence is plural because ""places"" is plural. Therefore, the verb should also be plural to agree in number. 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""are,"" which is plural. That matches the plural subject ""places."" In Sentence B, the verb is ""is,"" which is singular. That doesn't agree with the plural subject. So Sentence B is incorrect because of subject-verb disagreement. 

Wait, but sometimes there can be tricky cases where the subject might seem plural but is actually singular. For example, if the subject were a collective noun or if the complement is singular. Let me check the structure again. The sentence structure is ""The only places... are/is op-ed pages..."" The complement here is ""op-ed pages doing it-mostly-for giggles,"" which is plural. But the verb should agree with the subject, not the complement. So even if the complement were singular, the verb should still agree with the subject. 

For example, ""The key to the problems is solutions."" Here, ""key"" is singular, so ""is"" is correct even though the complement is plural. Similarly, in this case, the subject is plural (""places""), so the verb should be plural (""are""). Therefore, Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect. 

Another thing to check: sometimes people might confuse the subject with the complement. But the rule is that the verb agrees with the subject, not the complement. So even though the complement ""op-ed pages..."" is plural, the verb still needs to agree with ""places,"" which is plural. So ""are"" is correct. 

Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the incorrect verb ""is"" used with a plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""the only places""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

**Key Rule:** The verb must agree with the grammatical number of the subject, not the complement (e.g., ""op-ed pages..."")."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in sentence A and ""are"" in sentence B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The subject is ""the only places that connect the vulture and the shark story."" The verb should agree with this subject in number. 

The word ""places"" is plural, so the subject is plural. Therefore, the verb should also be plural. In sentence A, the verb is ""is,"" which is singular. That's a problem because a plural subject needs a plural verb. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is plural, so that should be correct.

Wait, but sometimes there are tricky cases where the subject might seem plural but is actually singular. Let me check again. The main noun here is ""places,"" which is definitely plural. The relative clause ""that connect the vulture and the shark story"" modifies ""places,"" but doesn't change the number. So the subject is still plural. 

Therefore, sentence B is correct because ""are"" agrees with the plural subject ""places."" Sentence A is incorrect because ""is"" is singular. 

I should also check if there's anything else that might affect this. The complement after the verb is ""op-ed pages,"" which is plural, but that doesn't affect the verb agreement. The verb should still agree with the subject, not the complement. 

So the conclusion is that sentence B is grammatical, and sentence A is ungrammatical due to subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

The grammatical sentence is **Sentence B**, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical. Here's why:

### Key Issue: **Subject-Verb Agreement**
- **Subject**: ""The only places that connect the vulture and the shark story""  
  The subject is **plural** (""places""), so the verb must also be plural.
- **Verb in Sentence A**: ""is"" (singular) → **incorrect**  
  Example of mismatch: *""places... is""*.
- **Verb in Sentence B**: ""are"" (plural) → **correct**  
  Proper agreement: *""places... are""*.

### Why Sentence B Works:
The plural verb ""are"" correctly matches the plural subject ""places."" The rest of the sentence (""op-ed pages doing it-mostly-for giggles"") acts as a complement and does not affect verb agreement.

### Correction:
- **Ungrammatical (A)**: ""The only places... **is**...""  
- **Grammatical (B)**: ""The only places... **are**...""  

**Final Answer**: Sentence B is grammatical; Sentence A is not."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, and the difference between them is the verb: ""are"" in A and ""is"" in B. 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, I should identify the subject in each sentence.

Looking at both sentences, the main clause starts after the relative clause. The structure is ""Technologies... are/is data visualization, [etc.]."" The subject here is ""Technologies,"" which is plural. The verb should agree with ""Technologies,"" so it should be plural. That would make ""are"" correct. 

Sentence A uses ""are,"" which matches the plural subject. Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is singular and doesn't agree with ""Technologies."" Therefore, Sentence A should be correct, and Sentence B incorrect. 

Wait, but sometimes there can be confusion when the subject is followed by a list. Let me double-check. The subject is still ""Technologies,"" even though the predicate nominative is a list of singular items. The verb must agree with the subject, not the predicate. So yes, ""are"" is correct here. 

Another way to test is to reverse the sentence: ""Data visualization, ... are/is technologies that..."" In that case, the verb would need to agree with ""data visualization,"" which is singular, so ""is."" But the original sentence's structure is different. The subject is ""Technologies,"" so the verb must be plural. 

So, conclusion: Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Technologies""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number. Sentence A correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject. Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), which creates a subject-verb disagreement.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: A plural subject requires a plural verb, and a singular subject requires a singular verb.  

**Example Breakdown:**  
- **Subject**: ""Technologies that can be supported..."" (plural).  
- **Correct Verb**: ""are"" (plural).  
- **Incorrect Verb**: ""is"" (singular).  

Sentence B would only be correct if the subject were singular, e.g., *""The technology that can be supported... **is**...""*."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are very similar except for the verb: Sentence A uses ""is"" and Sentence B uses ""are"". 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, I should identify the subject in each sentence.

Looking at both sentences, the main clause starts with ""Technologies that can be supported..."". The subject here is ""Technologies"", which is plural. The verb in the main clause is either ""is"" or ""are"". The predicate nominative part after the verb lists multiple items: data visualization, data federation, etc. 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""is"", which is singular. But the subject ""Technologies"" is plural. That seems like a mismatch. So ""Technologies... is..."" would be incorrect because the plural subject requires a plural verb. 

Sentence B uses ""are"", which is plural. That matches the plural subject ""Technologies"". So ""Technologies... are..."" is correct. 

Wait, but sometimes when the predicate nominative is a list, does that affect the verb? For example, if the subject is singular but the predicate is plural, does the verb still agree with the subject? Let me think. Yes, the verb should agree with the subject, not the predicate. So even if the predicate has multiple items, the verb still needs to match the subject. 

So in this case, the subject is ""Technologies"" (plural), so the verb should be ""are"". Therefore, Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject. 

I should also check if there's any other part of the sentence that might be confusing. The relative clause ""that can be supported to enable real-time business intelligence"" modifies ""Technologies"", but it doesn't affect the number of the subject. The main clause is ""Technologies... are data visualization, etc."" So the structure is correct in Sentence B. 

Another way to test is to simplify the sentence. Remove the relative clause: ""Technologies are data visualization, ..."" That sounds right. If we use ""is"", it would be ""Technologies is..."", which is clearly wrong. 

So the conclusion is that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical due to subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""Technologies"" (plural), so the verb must agree in number. Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb ""is"" to refer to the plural subject ""Technologies."" Sentence B correctly uses the plural verb ""are,"" ensuring proper subject-verb agreement.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Sentence A:** ""Technologies ... **is** ..."" → **Mismatch** (plural subject + singular verb).  
- **Sentence B:** ""Technologies ... **are** ..."" → **Correct** (plural subject + plural verb).  

The error in Sentence A violates the grammatical rule of subject-verb agreement."

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are about older adults engaging in certain activities and their life satisfaction.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used: Sentence A uses ""tend"" and Sentence B uses ""tends"". The subject here is ""Older adults who engage in sexual activity, intimacy, and companionship"". 

Now, the key point is subject-verb agreement. The subject is ""Older adults"", which is plural. The relative clause ""who engage..."" describes the older adults but doesn't change the plurality of the subject. So the main verb should agree with the plural subject. 

In Sentence A, ""tend"" is the base form for plural subjects, which matches ""older adults"". In Sentence B, ""tends"" is singular, which would be correct if the subject were singular, like ""an older adult"". But since the subject is plural, ""tends"" is incorrect here. 

Wait, let me double-check. Sometimes people get confused with complex subjects, especially when there's a relative clause. But the relative clause ""who engage..."" is modifying ""older adults"", which is plural. So the verb should still be plural. 

Another way to test is to simplify the sentence. Remove the relative clause: ""Older adults tend to be more satisfied with life."" That's correct. If it were ""Older adults tends..."", that's clearly wrong. So adding the relative clause doesn't affect the verb agreement. 

Therefore, Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect because of the singular verb with a plural subject.

**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Older adults""** (plural). The verb must agree with the plural subject, so the correct form is **""tend""** (Sentence A). Sentence B incorrectly uses **""tends""** (singular), which does not match the plural subject.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: A plural subject requires a plural verb (e.g., *adults **tend***).  
- A singular subject would require a singular verb (e.g., *an adult **tends***).  

The relative clause *""who engage in sexual activity, intimacy, and companionship""* does not affect the number of the main subject (""older adults""), so the verb must still agree with the plural noun."
12,tend,tends,3,"Older adults who engage in sexual activity, intimacy, and companionship tend to be more satisfied with life.","Older adults who engage in sexual activity, intimacy, and companionship tends to be more satisfied with life.",17,5920,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about older adults engaging in certain activities and their life satisfaction. The main difference between them is the verb: ""tends"" in A and ""tend"" in B.

First, I need to identify the subject of the verb. The sentence structure is ""Older adults who... tend(s) to be..."" The main subject here is ""Older adults,"" which is plural. The relative clause ""who engage in sexual activity, intimacy, and companionship"" describes the older adults but doesn't change the number of the subject. 

So, the verb should agree with the plural subject ""older adults."" That means the correct verb form is ""tend"" without the ""s."" Therefore, sentence B uses ""tend,"" which is correct, while sentence A incorrectly uses ""tends"" with a plural subject. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with intervening phrases. The relative clause might make someone think the verb is agreeing with something else, but no. The subject is still ""older adults,"" plural. So the verb must be plural as well. 

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. Remove the relative clause: ""Older adults tend to be more satisfied with life."" That's clearly correct. Adding the clause doesn't change the subject-verb agreement. So sentence B is correct, A is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""older adults"" (plural), so the verb must agree in number. The correct plural verb form is **""tend""** (Sentence B). Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb **""tends""**, which does not match the plural subject.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
Verbs must agree with their subjects in number. Plural subjects require plural verbs (e.g., *tend*), and singular subjects require singular verbs (e.g., *tends*). The phrase ""who engage in sexual activity, intimacy, and companionship"" is a relative clause modifying the subject but does not affect subject-verb agreement."
11,propose,proposes,3,"Alternative mechanisms, such as the optimal search rate hypothesis both propose that there is a tradeoff between search time and the probability of detecting prey.","Alternative mechanisms, such as the optimal search rate hypothesis both proposes that there is a tradeoff between search time and the probability of detecting prey.",25,6099,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about alternative mechanisms and the optimal search rate hypothesis.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""propose"" in Sentence A and ""proposes"" in Sentence B. The subject here is crucial. The sentence starts with ""Alternative mechanisms, such as the optimal search rate hypothesis both..."" Wait, the phrase ""such as"" is introducing an example, so the subject is ""Alternative mechanisms,"" which is plural. Then there's ""both,"" which usually pairs with ""and,"" but here it's part of the verb phrase. 

Wait, maybe the structure is ""Alternative mechanisms... both propose that..."" So ""both"" is referring to the two things: the alternative mechanisms and the optimal search rate hypothesis? But actually, ""such as"" is giving an example, so the optimal search rate hypothesis is an example of an alternative mechanism. So the subject is ""Alternative mechanisms,"" which is plural, and then ""both"" might be part of a compound subject. Wait, no, the sentence structure is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.

Original Sentence A: ""Alternative mechanisms, such as the optimal search rate hypothesis both propose that there is a tradeoff..."" The part after ""such as"" is an example, so the main subject is ""Alternative mechanisms,"" which is plural. The verb should agree with that. But then there's ""both"" after the example. Wait, maybe the sentence is structured as ""Alternative mechanisms, such as X, both propose..."" So ""both"" is referring to the alternative mechanisms and something else? But the way it's written, ""such as the optimal search rate hypothesis"" is a parenthetical example. So the main subject is ""Alternative mechanisms,"" plural, so the verb should be plural ""propose."" Therefore, Sentence A uses ""propose,"" which is correct for a plural subject. Sentence B uses ""proposes,"" which is singular, so that would be incorrect. 

But wait, maybe the ""both"" is causing confusion. If the sentence is ""Alternative mechanisms... both propose..."" then ""both"" is part of the subject. Wait, ""both"" is a determiner here. Wait, ""Alternative mechanisms, such as X, both propose..."" Hmm, maybe the ""both"" is redundant here. Because ""alternative mechanisms"" is plural, and ""such as X"" is an example. So the verb should still be plural. So ""propose"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect because it uses ""proposes"" with a plural subject. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in placing ""both."" If the sentence is trying to say that two things (alternative mechanisms and the optimal search rate hypothesis) both propose, but that's not the case because the hypothesis is an example of a mechanism. So the structure is ""Alternative mechanisms (such as X) both propose..."" which is incorrect because ""both"" would imply two things, but ""alternative mechanisms"" is plural, and ""such as X"" is an example. So maybe the use of ""both"" is incorrect here. Wait, but the user is focusing on the verb agreement. So regardless of the ""both,"" the main subject is plural, so the verb should be plural. Therefore, Sentence A is correct, Sentence B is wrong. 

Wait, but ""both"" is a quantifier. If the subject is ""Alternative mechanisms,"" which is plural, and ""both"" is used, but ""both"" usually refers to two items. So maybe the sentence is trying to say that two alternative mechanisms propose something, but the example given is only one (the optimal search rate hypothesis). That might be a separate issue, but the user is asking about grammaticality in terms of subject-verb agreement. So even if the use of ""both"" is logically incorrect (since only one example is given), the grammatical issue is the verb form. So the main subject is plural, so verb should be plural. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Alternative mechanisms""** (plural). The verb must agree with the plural subject, so the correct form is **""propose""** (plural).  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""propose""** to match the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""proposes""** (singular), which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Additional Note:**  
The phrase *""such as the optimal search rate hypothesis""* is a parenthetical example and does not affect subject-verb agreement. The word **""both""** here is redundant (since only one example is given), but it does not impact grammaticality. The core error in Sentence B is the singular verb form."
11,propose,proposes,3,"Alternative mechanisms, such as the optimal search rate hypothesis both propose that there is a tradeoff between search time and the probability of detecting prey.","Alternative mechanisms, such as the optimal search rate hypothesis both proposes that there is a tradeoff between search time and the probability of detecting prey.",25,6099,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are very similar, but there's a difference in the verb form: ""proposes"" in Sentence A and ""propose"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the verb. The sentence starts with ""Alternative mechanisms, such as the optimal search rate hypothesis both..."" Hmm, the main subject here is ""Alternative mechanisms,"" which is plural. The phrase ""such as the optimal search rate hypothesis"" is giving an example, so it's a parenthetical. Then there's the word ""both,"" which usually pairs with ""and"" to connect two things. Wait, in this sentence, ""both"" is used after the examples, but maybe it's trying to say that both the alternative mechanisms and the hypothesis propose something? But that doesn't make sense because the hypothesis is an example of the mechanisms.

Wait, maybe the structure is ""Alternative mechanisms... both propose..."" But ""both"" would require two things. Let me check the original sentences again. Sentence A: ""...both proposes that there is a tradeoff..."" Sentence B: ""...both propose that there is a tradeoff..."" 

The main subject is ""Alternative mechanisms,"" which is plural. The part after ""such as"" is just an example, so the verb should agree with the main subject. However, the word ""both"" is confusing here. If the sentence is saying that ""alternative mechanisms, such as X, both propose..."" then ""both"" would refer to two mechanisms. But the example given is only one mechanism (the optimal search rate hypothesis). So maybe the sentence is incorrectly using ""both"" when there's only one example. That might be a separate issue, but the user is specifically asking about the grammaticality of the verb agreement.

So, regardless of the ""both"" issue, the main subject is plural (""mechanisms""), so the verb should be plural. Sentence A uses ""proposes"" which is singular, so that's incorrect. Sentence B uses ""propose"" which is plural, so that's correct. Therefore, Sentence A is ungrammatical because of subject-verb disagreement, and Sentence B is grammatical. 

But wait, the presence of ""both"" might complicate things. ""Both"" is used when referring to two things. The sentence starts with ""Alternative mechanisms, such as..."" and then uses ""both."" If there's only one example given, maybe ""both"" is incorrect because it implies two examples. However, the user's question is about the grammaticality of the sentences as they are. Even if ""both"" is used incorrectly, the main issue is the verb agreement. So even if ""both"" is wrong, the verb still needs to agree with the plural subject. Therefore, Sentence B is correct in terms of verb agreement, even if the use of ""both"" is problematic for another reason. The user might not be asking about the ""both"" part, just the verb. So the answer is that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb is ""alternative mechanisms,"" which is plural. The phrase ""such as the optimal search rate hypothesis"" is a parenthetical example and does not affect subject-verb agreement. The plural subject requires the plural verb **""propose""** (Sentence B).  

In Sentence A, the singular verb **""proposes""** incorrectly agrees with the singular example (""hypothesis"") instead of the plural subject (""mechanisms""). Additionally, the use of ""both"" is awkward here because only one example is provided, but this does not affect grammaticality. The primary error is the subject-verb mismatch.  

**Key Issue:**  
- Sentence A: *proposes* (singular verb) → **ungrammatical**.  
- Sentence B: *propose* (plural verb) → **grammatical**."
9,is,are,3,"Spray application of herbicides, insecticides, and pesticides is essential to distribute these materials over the intended target surface.","Spray application of herbicides, insecticides, and pesticides are essential to distribute these materials over the intended target surface.",18,6624,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are about spray application of various chemicals being essential. The difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The main noun here is ""spray application."" Even though there are multiple items listed (herbicides, insecticides, pesticides), they are objects of the preposition ""of."" So the subject is singular: ""application."" 

In English, the verb must agree with the subject in number. Since ""application"" is singular, the verb should be singular as well. That means ""is"" is correct. Sentence A uses ""is,"" so that should be the grammatical one. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is plural, so that's incorrect. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused when there's a list following the subject. They might think the verb should agree with the items in the list. But in this case, the list is part of a prepositional phrase modifying the subject, not the subject itself. So the key is to identify the true subject, which is ""spray application."" 

Another way to test is to simplify the sentence. Remove the prepositional phrase: ""Spray application is essential..."" That still makes sense. If you tried ""Spray application are essential,"" it sounds wrong. So that confirms that ""is"" is correct. 

Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of subject-verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""spray application""** (singular), not the plural list of items (*herbicides, insecticides, and pesticides*), which is part of a prepositional phrase (*of herbicides...*). The verb must agree with the singular subject, so **""is""** (singular) is correct.  

- ✅ **Sentence A** uses **""is""** (singular verb), which matches the singular subject.  
- ❌ **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""are""** (plural verb), creating a subject-verb agreement error.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
The verb should always agree with the grammatical subject, not with the nouns in modifying phrases."

Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about spray application of various chemicals. The difference between them is the verb: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of each sentence. The main subject here is ""Spray application."" Even though ""herbicides, insecticides, and pesticides"" are listed, they are objects of the preposition ""of,"" so they don't affect the verb number. The verb should agree with the subject, which is singular (""application""). So the correct verb should be ""is"" as in Sentence B. Sentence A uses ""are,"" which is plural, so that's incorrect. 

Wait, but sometimes when there's a list after the subject, people might get confused. Let me double-check. The structure is ""Spray application of [list]."" The prepositional phrase ""of..."" modifies ""application,"" but the subject remains ""application,"" which is singular. Therefore, the verb should indeed be ""is."" So Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is wrong because of subject-verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Spray application""** (singular), not the plural list of items (*herbicides, insecticides, and pesticides*). The verb must agree with the singular subject, so **""is""** (Sentence B) is correct. Sentence A incorrectly uses **""are""**, which would only be appropriate if the subject itself were plural (e.g., *""Spray applications... are""*).  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
A prepositional phrase (e.g., *""of herbicides...""*) does not affect the verb's number. The verb must match the grammatical subject, not the object of the preposition."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are almost identical except for the verb ""appear"" in Sentence A and ""appears"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the verb. The main clause in both sentences starts with ""Remnants in the form of a stone tablet..."" So the subject here is ""Remnants."" The phrase ""in the form of a stone tablet"" is a prepositional phrase that modifies ""Remnants."" 

Now, the key is subject-verb agreement. The subject ""Remnants"" is plural because ""remnants"" is the plural form of ""remnant."" Therefore, the verb should agree with a plural subject. The verb in question is ""appear"" vs. ""appears."" ""Appear"" is the plural form, and ""appears"" is singular.

So, Sentence A uses ""appear,"" which is correct because the subject is plural. Sentence B uses ""appears,"" which is incorrect because it's singular. The prepositional phrase ""in the form of a stone tablet"" might be confusing because ""stone tablet"" is singular, but that doesn't change the subject's number. The subject remains ""Remnants,"" so the verb must be plural.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases like ""along with"" or ""as well as,"" but in this case, it's ""in the form of,"" which is just describing the remnants. The verb still agrees with the main subject, not the object of the preposition. 

So, Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect because of the subject-verb disagreement. The user might have thought that since the tablet is singular, the verb should be singular, but that's a common mistake. The subject is ""Remnants,"" which is plural, so the verb must be plural. 

Another way to check is to remove the prepositional phrase: ""Remnants appear to kite..."" vs. ""Remnants appears to kite..."" The second one clearly sounds wrong. So yes, Sentence B is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A is grammatical.**  
- **Sentence B is ungrammatical.**  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Remnants""** (plural), so the verb must agree with a plural subject. The phrase *""in the form of a stone tablet""* is a prepositional phrase modifying ""Remnants"" and does not affect the verb's number.  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses **""appear""** (plural verb).  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""appears""** (singular verb), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

**Key Tip:** Ignore prepositional phrases like *""in the form of...""* when determining subject-verb agreement. Focus on the core subject (""Remnants"")."
8,appear,appears,3,"Remnants in the form of a stone tablet appear to kite, giving him clues on how to proceed, before being destroyed by cubia.","Remnants in the form of a stone tablet appears to kite, giving him clues on how to proceed, before being destroyed by cubia.",23,6791,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are very similar, except for the verb ""appears"" in sentence A and ""appear"" in sentence B. The subject here is ""Remnants in the form of a stone tablet."" 

First, I need to figure out the subject-verb agreement. The main subject is ""Remnants,"" which is plural. The phrase ""in the form of a stone tablet"" is a prepositional phrase that describes the remnants. Prepositional phrases can sometimes confuse the subject-verb agreement because they come between the subject and the verb. But the key is that the verb should agree with the main subject, not the object of the preposition.

So, ""Remnants"" is plural, so the verb should be plural as well. In sentence A, the verb is ""appears,"" which is singular. That's a problem because the subject is plural. Sentence B uses ""appear,"" which is plural, so that should be correct. 

Wait, but maybe someone might think that ""a stone tablet"" is the subject. But no, the structure is ""Remnants in the form of a stone tablet."" The remnants are taking the form of a tablet, but the subject is still ""Remnants."" So the verb must agree with ""Remnants,"" not ""tablet."" 

Another thing to check is the rest of the sentence. The participle phrases ""giving him clues..."" and ""before being destroyed..."" are dependent clauses and don't affect the main subject-verb agreement. 

So, sentence A is incorrect because it uses a singular verb with a plural subject. Sentence B is correct because the plural verb ""appear"" matches the plural subject ""Remnants.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Remnants""** (plural), not ""a stone tablet"" (singular). The verb must agree with the plural subject, so the correct form is **""appear""** (Sentence B). Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb **""appears""**, which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: The phrase *""in the form of a stone tablet""* is a prepositional phrase modifying ""Remnants"" and does not change the grammatical number of the subject. The verb must match the plural ""Remnants.""  

**Corrected Sentence B:**  
*Remnants in the form of a stone tablet **appear** to Kite, giving him clues on how to proceed, before being destroyed by Cubia.*"
19,is,are,3,"Unless we deal with totalitarian states where govts control all the media and academics on both sides, there is no reason to dismiss domestic authors.","Unless we deal with totalitarian states where govts control all the media and academics on both sides, there are no reason to dismiss domestic authors.",25,6801,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are very similar except for the verb in the main clause: ""there is no reason"" vs. ""there are no reason."" 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject after ""there"" determines whether the verb is singular or plural. In Sentence A, ""no reason"" is singular because ""reason"" is a singular noun. So ""there is no reason"" should be correct. 

In Sentence B, ""there are no reason"" uses ""are,"" which is plural, but ""reason"" is still singular. That's a mismatch. The plural form would require ""reasons,"" like ""there are no reasons."" But the original sentence uses ""reason,"" so Sentence B is incorrect.

Wait, but sometimes ""there is"" can be used with plural nouns in informal contexts, but I think that's more for conversational English. In formal writing, strict agreement is expected. Here, the sentence seems formal, so ""there is"" with ""no reason"" is correct. 

Also, checking the rest of the sentences. Both have ""govts"" as an abbreviation, which is okay in informal writing but might be considered incorrect in formal contexts. However, the user is focusing on the grammaticality of the verb agreement, so that's the main issue here. 

So, conclusion: Sentence A is correct because ""is"" agrees with the singular ""reason."" Sentence B is incorrect because ""are"" doesn't agree with the singular noun.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The key difference lies in the subject-verb agreement in the main clause:  
- **Sentence A** uses *""there is no reason""*, where the singular verb *""is""* correctly agrees with the singular noun *""reason""*.  
- **Sentence B** uses *""there are no reason""*, which is incorrect because the plural verb *""are""* does not agree with the singular noun *""reason""*.  

To fix Sentence B, it would need to use *""there is no reason""* (matching Sentence A) or pluralize the noun to *""reasons""* (e.g., *""there are no reasons""*). However, the original context of the sentence likely intends the singular *""reason""*, making Sentence A the correct choice.  

**Note:** Both sentences use informal abbreviations like *""govts""* (instead of *""governments""*), which may be acceptable in casual writing but should be avoided in formal contexts."
19,is,are,3,"Unless we deal with totalitarian states where govts control all the media and academics on both sides, there is no reason to dismiss domestic authors.","Unless we deal with totalitarian states where govts control all the media and academics on both sides, there are no reason to dismiss domestic authors.",25,6801,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are very similar, so I need to look closely at the differences.

First, I'll read both sentences again to spot the differences. Sentence A says ""there are no reason to dismiss..."" while Sentence B says ""there is no reason to dismiss..."". The key difference here is the use of ""are"" versus ""is"" with ""no reason.""

Now, I remember that subject-verb agreement is crucial. The verb must agree with the subject in number. The subject here is ""reason,"" which is singular. So the verb should be singular as well. ""There is no reason"" would be correct because ""is"" is singular, matching ""reason."" In Sentence A, using ""are"" which is plural, doesn't agree with the singular ""reason."" That makes Sentence A incorrect.

Wait, but sometimes ""there are"" is used with plural nouns. For example, ""There are no reasons,"" where ""reasons"" is plural. But in both sentences, the noun is ""reason,"" singular. So Sentence B is correct because it uses ""is"" with the singular noun. Sentence A incorrectly uses ""are"" with a singular noun, leading to a subject-verb agreement error.

Another thing to check: sometimes in English, ""there's"" is used colloquially with plural nouns, but that's informal. In formal writing, the agreement should be strict. So in this case, since it's about grammatical correctness, Sentence B is right and A is wrong.

Also, looking at the rest of the sentences, both have ""govts"" which is an abbreviation. Maybe that's a typo, but the user didn't mention that. The main issue is the verb agreement. So the answer should be that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical due to the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The key difference lies in the subject-verb agreement in the phrase ""there is/are no reason"":  
- **Sentence A** uses *""there are no reason""*, which is incorrect because *""reason""* is singular. The plural verb *""are""* does not agree with the singular noun *""reason""*.  
- **Sentence B** uses *""there is no reason""*, which is correct. The singular verb *""is""* matches the singular noun *""reason""*.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- The abbreviation *""govts""* (governments) is informal but not inherently ungrammatical.  
- The phrase *""media and academics on both sides""* could be slightly ambiguous (does it mean ""media and academics that are on both sides"" or ""media on both sides and academics on both sides""?), but this does not affect grammaticality.  

**Conclusion:**  
Sentence B is grammatically correct, while Sentence A violates subject-verb agreement."
19,are,is,3,"The claims that partitioning the hard drive 1) reduces latency, and 2) reduces its life, are not mutually exclusive.","The claims that partitioning the hard drive 1) reduces latency, and 2) reduces its life, is not mutually exclusive.",19,7051,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about claims regarding partitioning a hard drive. 

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used in the main clause: Sentence A uses ""are not mutually exclusive,"" while Sentence B uses ""is not mutually exclusive."" 

The subject of the verb is ""The claims that..."" followed by two points. So, the key here is subject-verb agreement. The subject is plural because there are two claims: reducing latency and reducing the hard drive's life. Therefore, the verb should agree with a plural subject.

In Sentence A, ""are"" is plural, which matches ""claims."" That makes sense. In Sentence B, ""is"" is singular, which doesn't agree with the plural subject. So Sentence B is incorrect because the verb doesn't match the number of the subject. 

Wait, but let me double-check. The structure is ""The claims... are not mutually exclusive."" The claims (plural) are the things that are not mutually exclusive. So yes, ""are"" is correct. If the subject were singular, like ""The claim... is,"" then ""is"" would be right. But here it's plural, so ""are"" is needed. 

Another thing to check: the parenthetical numbers (1) and (2) in the sentences. They list the two claims. The way they're inserted into the sentence with commas around them—does that affect the structure? The core sentence is ""The claims that partitioning the hard drive reduces latency and reduces its life are not mutually exclusive."" The numbers are just enumerating the claims, so they don't change the subject-verb agreement. 

So, the main issue is definitely the verb. Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is singular, but the subject is plural. Therefore, Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""the claims"" (plural), so the verb must agree in number. Sentence A correctly uses the plural verb ""are,"" while Sentence B incorrectly uses the singular verb ""is."" The parenthetical numbering (1) and (2) does not affect the grammatical structure of the sentence. The core issue is subject-verb agreement."
19,are,is,3,"The claims that partitioning the hard drive 1) reduces latency, and 2) reduces its life, are not mutually exclusive.","The claims that partitioning the hard drive 1) reduces latency, and 2) reduces its life, is not mutually exclusive.",19,7051,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are about whether the claims are mutually exclusive. The main difference between them is the verb: Sentence A uses ""is"" and Sentence B uses ""are"". 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the verb. The sentence starts with ""The claims that..."" and then lists two claims. So the main subject here is ""claims"", which is plural. The verb that follows should agree with the subject in number. Since ""claims"" is plural, the verb should be ""are"" instead of ""is"". 

But wait, let me check the structure again. The sentence structure is ""The claims [that...] is/are not mutually exclusive."" The part in brackets is a relative clause modifying ""claims"". The main clause is ""The claims... are not mutually exclusive."" So the verb ""are"" should agree with ""claims"". 

In Sentence A, using ""is"" would be incorrect because the subject is plural. Sentence B uses ""are"", which is correct. 

Another thing to consider is the parenthetical numbers. The list items (1) and (2) are part of the claims. Even though they are separated by numbers, they are still part of the compound relative clause. The main subject remains ""claims"", so the verb should still be plural.

So, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb agreement error.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The subject of the sentence is **""The claims""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number. The verb phrase **""are not mutually exclusive""** (plural) correctly matches the plural subject.  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular), which clashes with the plural subject ""claims.""  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses **""are""** (plural), ensuring subject-verb agreement.  

The parenthetical numbering (**1) reduces latency, and 2) reduces its life**) does not affect the grammatical structure of the main clause. The core issue is the mismatch between the plural subject and singular verb in Sentence A.  

**Correct Sentence:**  
*The claims that partitioning the hard drive 1) reduces latency, and 2) reduces its life, **are** not mutually exclusive.*"
16,have,has,3,"High sedimentation loads in the water column, such as those associated with residential construction, have a negative effect on settling sea urchins.","High sedimentation loads in the water column, such as those associated with residential construction, has a negative effect on settling sea urchins.",22,7193,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. Both sentences are almost identical except for the verb used: ""have"" in Sentence A and ""has"" in Sentence B. The subject here is ""High sedimentation loads in the water column."" 

First, I need to identify the subject and determine if it's singular or plural. The main noun here is ""loads,"" which is plural. The phrase ""in the water column"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""loads."" The part after ""such as"" is giving an example, so it's not affecting the subject-verb agreement.

So, the subject is plural (""loads""), so the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Have"" is the plural form, and ""has"" is singular. Therefore, Sentence A uses ""have,"" which is correct, and Sentence B uses ""has,"" which is incorrect because the subject is plural. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases between the subject and verb. For example, if the subject was ""sedimentation,"" which is singular, then ""has"" would be correct. But in this case, the subject is ""loads,"" which is plural. So the verb should be plural. 

Let me double-check. The structure is ""High sedimentation loads... have/has a negative effect..."" Since ""loads"" is the head noun, the verb must agree with it. So yes, ""have"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""High sedimentation loads in the water column""**, which is plural (""loads""). The verb must agree with the plural subject, so the correct form is **""have""** (Sentence A). Sentence B incorrectly uses **""has""**, which is singular and does not match the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: Plural subject (""loads"") requires a plural verb (""have"").  
- The phrase **""such as those associated with residential construction""** is a non-essential modifier and does not affect the subject-verb agreement.  

Thus, **Sentence A** is correct."
16,have,has,3,"High sedimentation loads in the water column, such as those associated with residential construction, have a negative effect on settling sea urchins.","High sedimentation loads in the water column, such as those associated with residential construction, has a negative effect on settling sea urchins.",22,7193,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. Both sentences are almost identical except for the verb ""has"" in Sentence A and ""have"" in Sentence B. The subject here is ""High sedimentation loads in the water column."" 

First, I need to figure out the subject-verb agreement. The main subject is ""loads,"" which is plural. The verb needs to agree with the subject in number. So, ""loads"" is plural, so the verb should be plural as well. ""Have"" is plural, and ""has"" is singular. Therefore, Sentence B with ""have"" should be correct.

But wait, there's a complicating factor here. The sentence has a parenthetical phrase: ""such as those associated with residential construction."" Parenthetical phrases can sometimes confuse the subject-verb agreement because they come between the subject and the verb. However, in this case, the phrase is set off by commas, so it's non-restrictive. That means the verb should still agree with the main subject, which is ""loads,"" not the examples in the parenthetical. 

So even though the parenthetical adds extra information, the verb must still match ""loads."" Since ""loads"" is plural, ""have"" is correct. Sentence A uses ""has,"" which is singular, so it's incorrect. 

Another way to check is to remove the parenthetical to see if the sentence still makes sense. If we take out ""such as those associated with residential construction,"" Sentence A becomes ""High sedimentation loads in the water column has a negative effect..."" which clearly has a subject-verb disagreement. Sentence B becomes ""High sedimentation loads in the water column have a negative effect..."" which is correct. 

Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the incorrect verb form.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""High sedimentation loads in the water column""**, which is plural (*loads*). The verb must agree with the plural subject, so **""have""** (plural) is correct.  

Sentence A incorrectly uses **""has""** (singular), which does not match the plural subject. The parenthetical phrase **""such as those associated with residential construction""** does not affect subject-verb agreement, as it is a non-restrictive clause set off by commas.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Always ensure the verb matches the grammatical number of the subject, ignoring intervening phrases."
13,are,is,3,"Distinct whole areas that have a notably high property price in the town are bedgrove, the conservation area around st.","Distinct whole areas that have a notably high property price in the town is bedgrove, the conservation area around st.",20,7279,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about areas in a town with high property prices. 

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used: Sentence A uses ""are"" and Sentence B uses ""is"". The subject in both cases is ""Distinct whole areas that have a notably high property price in the town"". 

So, the key here is subject-verb agreement. The subject is a noun phrase starting with ""Distinct whole areas"", which is plural because ""areas"" is plural. The verb needs to agree with the subject in number. 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""are"", which is plural. That matches the plural subject ""areas"". So that should be correct. 

In Sentence B, the verb is ""is"", which is singular. That doesn't agree with the plural subject. So Sentence B is incorrect. 

Wait, but sometimes even if the subject is long, the main noun determines the verb. Let me check again. The main noun here is ""areas"", which is plural. The relative clause ""that have a notably high property price in the town"" is just adding more info about the areas. So the verb should definitely be plural. 

Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical because ""are"" matches the plural subject. Sentence B is ungrammatical because ""is"" is singular and doesn't agree with the plural subject. 

I should also check if there's any inversion or other structure that might affect this. The sentences are structured as ""Distinct whole areas... are/is Bedgrove..."". Here, the subject is ""Distinct whole areas..."", and the complement is ""Bedgrove..."". In such cases, the verb should agree with the subject, not the complement. So even though the complement is singular (""Bedgrove, the conservation area...""), the subject is plural, so the verb should be plural. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct sentence is A, and B is wrong.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Explanation:  
The subject of the sentence is **""Distinct whole areas...""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- **Sentence A** uses **""are""** (plural verb), which correctly matches the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

### Key Issue:  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: The plural subject (""areas"") requires a plural verb (""are""). The singular verb ""is"" in Sentence B clashes with the plural subject.  

### Corrected Structure:  
> *Distinct whole areas [...] **are** Bedgrove [...]* (plural subject + plural verb).  

Sentence B violates this rule and is therefore ungrammatical."
13,are,is,3,"Distinct whole areas that have a notably high property price in the town are bedgrove, the conservation area around st.","Distinct whole areas that have a notably high property price in the town is bedgrove, the conservation area around st.",20,7279,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are almost identical except for the verb: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs. So, I should look at the subject of each sentence.

The subject in both sentences is ""Distinct whole areas that have a notably high property price in the town."" Let's break that down. The main noun here is ""areas,"" which is plural. The rest of the phrase, ""Distinct whole...price in the town,"" is just modifying ""areas."" So the subject is plural. 

The verb in question is either ""is"" or ""are."" Since the subject is plural, the verb should also be plural. ""Are"" is the plural form, so Sentence B should be correct. Sentence A uses ""is,"" which is singular, so that would be incorrect because it doesn't agree with the plural subject.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes there can be confusion with phrases that come after the verb. In these sentences, the structure is ""X is/are Y."" Here, Y is ""Bedgrove, the conservation area around st."" That part seems to be a list of examples of the areas. So the subject is ""areas,"" plural, and the verb should be ""are."" 

Another way to test this is to reverse the sentence. If we say ""Bedgrove, the conservation area around st., is/are distinct whole areas..."" then the subject becomes ""Bedgrove,"" which is singular, so you'd use ""is."" But in the original sentences, the subject is ""areas,"" so the verb must agree with that. 

Therefore, Sentence B is correct because ""are"" matches the plural subject ""areas."" Sentence A is incorrect because ""is"" is singular. The user might be confused because sometimes when the complement is singular, people might mistakenly use a singular verb, but the rule is that the verb agrees with the subject, not the complement. 

So the answer is that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical due to subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""Distinct whole areas...""*, which is plural. The verb must agree with the plural subject, so the correct form is **""are""** (Sentence B). Sentence A incorrectly uses **""is""**, a singular verb, which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The plural subject (*areas*) requires a plural verb (*are*).  
- **Why Sentence A Fails:** ""Is"" (singular) cannot pair with ""areas"" (plural).  

**Corrected Structure:**  
*Distinct whole areas [...] **are** Bedgrove, the conservation area around St.*"
16,count,counts,4,Two detectors at exactly the same scattering angle to the left and right of the foil count the number of scattered electrons.,Two detectors at exactly the same scattering angle to the left and right of the foil counts the number of scattered electrons.,22,67,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Both are about two detectors counting electrons. The main difference between them is the verb: Sentence A uses ""count"" and Sentence B uses ""counts"". 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. Here, the subject is ""Two detectors"", which is plural. So the verb should agree with that.

Looking at Sentence A: ""Two detectors... count the number..."" Since ""detectors"" is plural, ""count"" is the correct plural form. That seems right. 

Sentence B: ""Two detectors... counts the number..."" Here, ""counts"" is singular. But the subject is plural, so this should be incorrect. The verb doesn't agree with the subject. 

Wait, but maybe there's a prepositional phrase or something that could confuse the subject. Let me check the sentence structure. The subject is ""Two detectors"", then there's a prepositional phrase modifying it: ""at exactly the same scattering angle to the left and right of the foil"". That phrase describes the detectors but doesn't change the subject's number. So the main verb still needs to agree with ""Two detectors"", which is plural. 

So Sentence B is wrong because it uses ""counts"" (singular) with a plural subject. Sentence A is correct. 

I should also check if there's any other part of the sentence that might affect the verb. For example, sometimes phrases like ""as well as"" or ""along with"" can trick you, but here it's just modifiers. The core sentence is ""Two detectors count..."", so the verb should definitely be plural. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes collective nouns can be tricky, but ""detectors"" is clearly plural. So yeah, Sentence A is grammatical, B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of both sentences is **""Two detectors""** (plural). The verb must agree in number with the subject.  

- **Sentence A** uses **""count""** (plural verb), which correctly matches the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses **""counts""** (singular verb), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

The prepositional phrases (""at exactly the same scattering angle..."") do not affect the grammatical number of the subject. Thus, only **Sentence A** is correct."
16,count,counts,4,Two detectors at exactly the same scattering angle to the left and right of the foil count the number of scattered electrons.,Two detectors at exactly the same scattering angle to the left and right of the foil counts the number of scattered electrons.,22,67,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about two detectors counting electrons. Let me start by reading both sentences carefully.

Sentence A: ""Two detectors at exactly the same scattering angle to the left and right of the foil counts the number of scattered electrons.""

Sentence B: ""Two detectors at exactly the same scattering angle to the left and right of the foil count the number of scattered electrons.""

The main difference between them is the verb: ""counts"" in A and ""count"" in B. The subject here is ""Two detectors,"" which is plural. So, the verb should agree with the subject in number. Plural subjects take plural verbs. ""Counts"" is singular (third person singular present tense), while ""count"" is plural. Therefore, Sentence B should be correct because ""two detectors"" (plural) need the plural verb ""count."" Sentence A uses ""counts,"" which is singular, so that's a subject-verb agreement error. 

Wait, but sometimes prepositional phrases can confuse the subject. Let me check the structure again. The subject is ""Two detectors,"" and the rest is a prepositional phrase modifying it: ""at exactly the same scattering angle to the left and right of the foil."" The verb should still agree with ""detectors,"" not with anything in the prepositional phrase. So yes, ""count"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and A is not. 

I should also consider if there's any other possible issue. For example, maybe the placement of modifiers, but both sentences have the same structure except for the verb. So the only error is the subject-verb agreement. Yep, that's it. So the answer is that Sentence B is correct, and A is incorrect.
</think>

The grammatical sentence is **Sentence B**, and the ungrammatical one is **Sentence A**.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of both sentences is **""Two detectors""** (plural).  
- The verb must agree with the plural subject in number.  
  - Sentence A incorrectly uses **""counts""** (singular verb), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  
  - Sentence B correctly uses **""count""** (plural verb), matching the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:**  
The error in Sentence A arises from the proximity of the singular noun **""foil""** (part of a prepositional phrase) to the verb, which might misleadingly suggest singular agreement. However, the verb must agree with the actual subject (**""Two detectors""**), not with intervening phrases.  

Thus, **Sentence B** is grammatically correct."
19,are,is,4,"The last words spoken on the disc two portion of the album, during the song outside the wall are ""isn't this where"".","The last words spoken on the disc two portion of the album, during the song outside the wall is ""isn't this where"".",22,426,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are very similar, but there's a difference in the verb used: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to identify the subject that the verb is referring to. The main clause in both sentences is about ""the last words spoken..."" So the subject here is ""the last words."" Now, ""words"" is plural, so the verb should agree with that. The verb in the main clause is either ""are"" or ""is."" Since ""words"" is plural, the correct verb should be ""are."" That would make Sentence A correct.

But wait, let me check the structure again. The sentence structure is a bit complex with some modifiers. The main clause is ""The last words... are 'isn't this where'."" The part after ""spoken on..."" are prepositional phrases modifying ""words."" So the core sentence is ""The last words... are..."" So yes, the subject is ""words,"" plural, so ""are"" is correct. 

Sentence B uses ""is,"" which would be correct if the subject were singular. But since the subject is ""words,"" which is plural, ""is"" doesn't agree. Therefore, Sentence B is ungrammatical because of subject-verb disagreement. 

I should also check if there's any other part of the sentence that might affect this. The phrase ""during the song outside the wall"" is a prepositional phrase modifying the time or context when the words are spoken. It doesn't affect the subject-verb agreement. The quotation at the end is the object, so it doesn't change the verb. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes when the subject is a quote, people might mistakenly use singular verbs, but in this case, the subject is ""words,"" not the quote itself. The quote is the complement, so the verb still needs to agree with ""words."" 

So, conclusion: Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""the last words""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

The intervening phrases (*""spoken on the disc two portion of the album, during the song outside the wall""*) do not affect the grammatical number of the subject. The quotation *""isn't this where""* acts as a predicate nominative and does not influence verb agreement.  

Thus, **Sentence A** is correct, and **Sentence B** is ungrammatical."
19,are,is,4,"The last words spoken on the disc two portion of the album, during the song outside the wall are ""isn't this where"".","The last words spoken on the disc two portion of the album, during the song outside the wall is ""isn't this where"".",22,426,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are very similar except for the verb: one uses ""is"" and the other ""are"". The main difference is subject-verb agreement.

First, I need to identify the subject of the sentence. The sentence structure is a bit complex with some modifiers. The main clause is ""The last words... is/are 'isn't this where'."" The subject here is ""The last words"". ""Spoken on the disc two portion of the album"" and ""during the song outside the wall"" are participial phrases modifying ""the last words"". 

Now, ""words"" is plural, so the verb should agree with a plural subject. That would mean using ""are"" instead of ""is"". So sentence B uses ""are"", which should be correct. Sentence A uses ""is"", which is singular and doesn't agree with the plural subject ""words"". 

But wait, sometimes even if the subject seems plural, if it's considered a single entity, the verb might be singular. For example, ""The last words of the song is..."" but that's not the case here. ""The last words"" are definitely plural. Each word is part of the phrase, but collectively they form a plural subject. So ""are"" is correct. 

Another thing to check is the placement of commas. The sentence has commas around the participial phrases, which might make it a bit confusing, but the core structure remains the same. The subject is still ""The last words"", so the verb must agree with that. 

Therefore, sentence B is grammatical because it uses ""are"" to match the plural subject ""words"". Sentence A is ungrammatical because it incorrectly uses ""is"" with a plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""The last words""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number. The correct plural verb is **""are""** (Sentence B). Sentence A incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular), which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement:** ""Words"" (plural) → ""are"" (plural).  
- **Distractor:** The interrupting phrases (*""spoken on the disc two portion... during the song...""*) might confuse the reader, but they do not affect the subject-verb agreement.  

**Corrected Sentence B:**  
*The last words spoken on the disc two portion of the album, during the song ""Outside the Wall,"" are ""isn't this where.""*  

*(Note: Minor punctuation adjustments, like adding quotes around the song title and a comma after ""Wall,"" improve clarity but were not the focus of the original question.)*"

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both very similar except for the verb at the end. 

First, I need to look at the structure of each sentence. Both start with ""The novel is heavily influenced by Goethe's Faust, and its themes of cowardice, trust, intellectual curiosity, and redemption..."" Then, sentence A ends with ""are prominent,"" while B ends with ""is prominent.""

The key difference here is the verb: ""are"" vs. ""is."" The subject that the verb is referring to is crucial. Let's break down the sentence. The main clause is ""The novel is heavily influenced..."" Then there's a conjunction ""and"" connecting it to another independent clause. The second clause is ""its themes of [list] are/is prominent.""

So, the subject of the second clause is ""themes,"" which is plural because there are multiple themes listed: cowardice, trust, intellectual curiosity, and redemption. Since ""themes"" is plural, the verb should agree in number. Plural subjects take plural verbs. ""Are"" is plural, and ""is"" is singular. 

Therefore, sentence A uses ""are,"" which matches the plural subject ""themes,"" making it correct. Sentence B incorrectly uses ""is,"" which is singular, leading to a subject-verb disagreement. 

Wait, let me double-check. The structure is ""its themes... are prominent."" The word ""its"" is a possessive pronoun referring to the novel, but the subject here is ""themes,"" so the verb must agree with ""themes."" Yes, that's right. Even though ""its"" is singular, the noun it's modifying is ""themes,"" which is plural. So the verb should be plural. 

Another way to test this is to simplify the sentence. Remove the list of themes: ""its themes are prominent"" vs. ""its themes is prominent."" Clearly, ""themes are"" is correct. So sentence A is grammatical, and B is not because of the verb agreement error.
</think>

**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: The subject of the second clause is ""themes"" (plural), so the verb must also be plural (""**are**"").  
- **Error in Sentence B**: Using ""**is**"" (singular) with the plural subject ""themes"" violates grammatical agreement.  

**Correct**:  
*The novel is heavily influenced by Goethe's Faust, and its themes [...]* **are** *prominent.*  

**Incorrect**:  
*The novel is heavily influenced by Goethe's Faust, and its themes [...]* **is** *prominent.*  

The error in Sentence B is a classic case of mismatched subject-verb number agreement."
23,are,is,4,"The novel is heavily influenced by goethe's faust, and its themes of cowardice, trust, intellectual curiosity, and redemption are prominent.","The novel is heavily influenced by goethe's faust, and its themes of cowardice, trust, intellectual curiosity, and redemption is prominent.",20,655,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Both start the same way: ""The novel is heavily influenced by Goethe's Faust, and its themes of cowardice, trust, intellectual curiosity, and redemption..."" Then, sentence A ends with ""is prominent,"" and B ends with ""are prominent.""

First, I need to figure out the subject-verb agreement here. The main clause after ""and"" is about the themes. The subject is ""themes,"" which is plural. So the verb should agree with that. ""Themes"" are plural, so the verb should be plural as well. ""Are"" is plural, and ""is"" is singular.

Looking at sentence A: ""...its themes... is prominent."" That's a problem because ""themes"" is plural, but the verb ""is"" is singular. That's a subject-verb disagreement. So sentence A is incorrect.

Sentence B uses ""are prominent,"" which matches the plural subject ""themes."" So sentence B is correct.

Wait, but maybe there's something else. Let me check again. The structure is ""its themes of [list] is/are prominent."" The subject is definitely ""themes,"" regardless of the prepositional phrase ""of cowardice..."" So the verb should still agree with ""themes."" Yep, so ""are"" is correct. Therefore, sentence B is grammatical, and A is not.

Another thing to check: sometimes people get confused with compound subjects, but here it's a list within a prepositional phrase modifying ""themes."" The verb still needs to agree with ""themes."" So no, the list doesn't affect the verb form here. So definitely, sentence B is correct.
</think>

**Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **grammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject in the second clause is **""its themes""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular) with the plural subject ""themes.""  
- Sentence B correctly uses **""are""** (plural), matching the plural subject.  

**Corrected Sentence B:**  
*The novel is heavily influenced by Goethe's Faust, and its themes of cowardice, trust, intellectual curiosity, and redemption are prominent.*  

**Note:** Proper nouns like ""Goethe"" and ""Faust"" should also be capitalized."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, and the difference between them is the verb used: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B. 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, the key here is to identify the subject in each sentence and determine if it's singular or plural.

Looking at both sentences, the main clause structure is ""The criteria ... are/is persistence, bioaccumulation, etc."" The subject here is ""criteria."" Wait, ""criteria"" is actually the plural form of ""criterion."" So, ""criteria"" is plural. Therefore, the verb should agree with a plural subject. 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""are,"" which is plural. That matches with ""criteria"" being plural. In Sentence B, the verb is ""is,"" which is singular. That would be incorrect because the subject is plural. 

But wait, sometimes people might confuse ""criteria"" as singular because it's often used that way colloquially. However, in formal grammar, ""criteria"" is plural. So, Sentence B is using a singular verb with a plural subject, making it ungrammatical. 

Another way to check is to reverse the sentence. If I say ""Persistence, bioaccumulation... are the criteria,"" that makes sense. If I use ""is,"" it would be ""Persistence... is the criteria,"" which is wrong because ""criteria"" is plural. 

So, Sentence A is correct because ""are"" agrees with the plural subject ""criteria."" Sentence B is incorrect because ""is"" doesn't agree. 

I should also check if there's any other part of the sentence that might affect the subject-verb agreement. The prepositional phrases ""for forwarding a proposed chemical..."" and ""to the risk profile..."" don't change the number of the subject. The subject is still ""criteria."" 

Therefore, the conclusion is that Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical due to subject-verb disagreement.

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""criteria""**, which is the **plural** form of ""criterion."" The verb must agree in number with the subject.  

- In **Sentence A**, the plural verb **""are""** correctly matches the plural subject **""criteria.""**  
- In **Sentence B**, the singular verb **""is""** incorrectly disagrees with the plural subject **""criteria.""**  

**Key Rule:**  
Plural subjects require plural verbs. Since ""criteria"" is plural, **""are""** is correct."

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""criteria,"" which is plural. The verb should agree with the subject in number. So, plural subject takes a plural verb. ""Criteria"" is the plural form of ""criterion,"" so the correct verb should be ""are."" That would make Sentence B correct. 

But wait, sometimes people might confuse ""criteria"" as singular because it ends with -a, similar to some singular Latin-derived words. But no, ""criteria"" is definitely plural. The singular is ""criterion."" So if the subject were ""criterion,"" then ""is"" would be correct. But here it's ""criteria,"" so ""are"" is needed. 

Looking at the sentences again: Sentence A uses ""is,"" which is singular, and Sentence B uses ""are,"" plural. Since the subject is plural, Sentence B is correct. Sentence A is incorrect because it uses a singular verb with a plural subject. 

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. Remove the prepositional phrases: ""The criteria... are..."" Yep, that sounds right. If it were ""criterion,"" then ""is"" would fit. So the key here is recognizing that ""criteria"" is plural. 

I should also check if there's any other part of the sentence that might affect the verb, but the rest of the sentence lists multiple criteria (persistence, bioaccumulation, etc.), which reinforces that the subject is plural. So the verb must agree with ""criteria,"" leading to ""are."" Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""criteria,"" which is the plural form of ""criterion."" The verb must agree with the plural subject, so ""are"" (plural) is correct. Sentence A incorrectly uses ""is"" (singular), violating subject-verb agreement.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Sentence A:** ""The criteria ... **is** ..."" → Incorrect (singular verb with plural subject).  
- **Sentence B:** ""The criteria ... **are** ..."" → Correct (plural verb matches plural subject).  

**Tip:** To avoid confusion, remember that ""criteria"" always requires a plural verb."
13,are,is,4,"Offences for which an adult would receive life imprisonment, except murder, are subject to a three-year maximum for the young offender.","Offences for which an adult would receive life imprisonment, except murder, is subject to a three-year maximum for the young offender.",21,1510,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about legal terms regarding offenses and young offenders. 

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used in the second part. Sentence A uses ""are subject"" and Sentence B uses ""is subject"". So the key here is subject-verb agreement.

The subject in question here is ""Offences for which an adult would receive life imprisonment, except murder"". Let me break that down. The core noun here is ""Offences"", which is plural. The phrase ""for which an adult would receive life imprisonment"" is a relative clause modifying ""Offences"". Then there's the parenthetical ""except murder"", which is setting aside murder from those offences. 

So the main subject is ""Offences..."", which is plural. Therefore, the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Are"" is plural, and ""is"" is singular. So Sentence A uses ""are"", which matches the plural subject, making it correct. Sentence B uses ""is"", which is singular and doesn't agree with the plural subject, so that's incorrect.

Wait, but maybe the parenthetical ""except murder"" could affect the subject? Let me think. The phrase ""except murder"" is like saying ""excluding murder"". So the subject is all offences that would get life imprisonment except for murder. So the subject is still plural because we're talking about multiple offences (just excluding one). Therefore, the verb should still be plural. 

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. Remove the parenthetical: ""Offences... are subject to..."" vs ""Offences... is subject to..."". Clearly, ""Offences are"" is correct. Adding ""except murder"" doesn't change the number of the subject. So Sentence A is correct, B is wrong.

I should also check if there's any other part of the sentence that might affect this. The main clause is ""Offences... are subject to a three-year maximum..."". The verb ""are"" is correctly plural. In Sentence B, using ""is"" would be a subject-verb disagreement. 

So the answer is that Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the verb agreement error.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""Offences"" (plural), so the verb must agree in number. Sentence A correctly uses the plural verb **""are""** to match the plural subject. Sentence B incorrectly uses the singular verb **""is""**, creating a subject-verb agreement error.  

**Key Issue:**  
- The phrase ""except murder"" is a parenthetical clause and does not affect the grammatical number of the subject (""Offences""). The verb must still agree with the plural noun ""Offences."""
13,are,is,4,"Offences for which an adult would receive life imprisonment, except murder, are subject to a three-year maximum for the young offender.","Offences for which an adult would receive life imprisonment, except murder, is subject to a three-year maximum for the young offender.",21,1510,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are very similar, except for the verb: Sentence A uses ""is"" and Sentence B uses ""are"". The main task here is to determine subject-verb agreement.

First, I need to identify the subject of the sentence. The sentence starts with ""Offences for which an adult would receive life imprisonment, except murder,"". The core noun here is ""Offences"", which is plural. The phrase ""except murder"" is a parenthetical element, so it doesn't affect the number of the subject. 

So the subject is ""Offences..."", which is plural. Therefore, the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Are"" is the plural form, so Sentence B uses the correct verb. Sentence A uses ""is"", which is singular, so that's incorrect. 

Wait, but sometimes when there's a prepositional phrase or a clause between the subject and verb, people might get confused. Let me check again. The structure is ""Offences... are subject..."". The part between commas ""for which... except murder"" is just adding information about the offences. The main clause is ""Offences... are subject..."". So yes, ""are"" is correct. 

Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the singular verb ""is"" with a plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""Offences"" (plural), and the verb must agree in number. The phrase ""except murder"" is a parenthetical aside and does not affect the subject-verb agreement. Since ""offences"" is plural, the correct verb is **""are""** (Sentence B). Sentence A incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular), which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement:** Plural subject (""Offences"") requires a plural verb (""are"").  
- **Parenthetical Phrase:** ""Except murder"" is non-essential and does not alter the grammatical number of the subject."

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are about the forms of waste produced and whether they contain certain elements.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb: Sentence A uses ""contain"" and Sentence B uses ""contains"". My initial thought is that subject-verb agreement is the key here. 

The subject in both sentences is ""The two forms of waste produced"". The phrase ""a noble metal form and a ceramic form"" is in apposition, meaning it's giving more information about the two forms. So the core subject is ""two forms"", which is plural. 

In English, plural subjects take plural verbs. The verb ""contain"" is plural, while ""contains"" is singular. Therefore, Sentence A uses the correct plural verb ""contain"" to agree with the plural subject ""two forms"". Sentence B incorrectly uses ""contains"", which is singular, leading to a subject-verb disagreement. 

Wait, let me double-check. Sometimes with appositives, people might get confused, but the appositive here is just adding extra info and doesn't change the number of the subject. So even though the appositive lists two singular items (""a noble metal form and a ceramic form""), the main subject is still plural. Therefore, the verb should be plural. 

Another way to test this is to remove the appositive. If we take out the part between the commas, the sentence becomes ""The two forms of waste produced contain no plutonium..."" which clearly needs the plural verb. So Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is wrong because it uses the singular ""contains"" with a plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""The two forms of waste produced""* (plural), so the verb must agree in number. The plural verb **""contain""** (Sentence A) correctly matches the plural subject. Sentence B incorrectly uses the singular verb **""contains""**, which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: The appositive phrase *""a noble metal form and a ceramic form""* (also plural) reinforces the plurality of the subject, but even without it, the core subject (*""two forms""*) remains plural.  

**Ungrammatical Fix (Sentence B):**  
To correct Sentence B, replace *""contains""* with *""contain""*."
16,contain,contains,4,"The two forms of waste produced, a noble metal form and a ceramic form, contain no plutonium or other actinides.","The two forms of waste produced, a noble metal form and a ceramic form, contains no plutonium or other actinides.",20,1540,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: Sentence A or Sentence B. Both sentences are very similar, except for the verb ""contains"" in A and ""contain"" in B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The main clause is ""The two forms of waste produced... contain(s) no plutonium or other actinides."" The part between the commas is an appositive, which gives more information about the two forms. So the subject is ""The two forms of waste produced,"" right? The verb has to agree with this subject in number.

The subject is ""two forms,"" which is plural. So the verb should be plural as well. In Sentence A, the verb is ""contains,"" which is singular. Sentence B uses ""contain,"" the plural form. That makes me think Sentence B is correct because the plural subject requires a plural verb. 

Wait, but sometimes even when the subject is plural, if there's a prepositional phrase or something between the subject and verb, people might get confused. But in this case, the appositive ""a noble metal form and a ceramic form"" is just adding extra info. The main subject is still ""two forms,"" so the verb should agree with that. 

Let me double-check. If I remove the appositive, the sentence becomes ""The two forms of waste produced contain no plutonium..."" That sounds right. If I use ""contains,"" it would be ""The two forms... contains,"" which is clearly wrong. So yes, Sentence B is correct. Sentence A has a subject-verb agreement error because the singular verb ""contains"" doesn't match the plural subject ""two forms.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""The two forms of waste produced""* (plural), so the verb must agree in number. The plural verb **""contain""** (Sentence B) correctly matches the plural subject. Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb **""contains""**, which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
Verbs must agree with their subjects in number. Plural subjects require plural verbs. The appositive phrase *""a noble metal form and a ceramic form""* does not affect subject-verb agreement."
10,demonstrate,demonstrates,4,"Experiments confirming the role of kin selection in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, which can lead to lower average relatedness between workers.","Experiments confirming the role of kin selection in worker policing demonstrates the effects of multiple matings, which can lead to lower average relatedness between workers.",25,1615,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are very similar except for the verb following ""Experiments..."". Sentence A uses ""demonstrate"" and Sentence B uses ""demonstrates"". 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the verb. The main clause starts with ""Experiments confirming the role of kin selection in worker policing..."" Here, ""Experiments"" is the subject. The verb that follows should agree with this subject in number. Since ""Experiments"" is plural, the verb should be plural as well. ""Demonstrate"" is the plural form, while ""demonstrates"" is singular.

So, Sentence A uses ""demonstrate"" which matches the plural subject ""Experiments"", making it correct. Sentence B incorrectly uses ""demonstrates"", which is singular, leading to a subject-verb agreement error. 

I should also check if there's anything else that might affect the subject-verb agreement. The phrase ""confirming the role..."" is a participial phrase modifying ""Experiments"", but it doesn't change the number of the subject. The main verb is still determined by ""Experiments"". 

Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the verb form.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb ""demonstrate/demonstrates"" is ""Experiments"" (plural). The verb must agree in number with its subject:  
- **Sentence A** correctly uses the plural verb **""demonstrate""** to match the plural subject ""Experiments.""  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses the singular verb **""demonstrates""**, which clashes with the plural subject.  

The error in Sentence B is a **subject-verb agreement mistake**. The rest of both sentences is structurally identical and grammatically sound."
10,demonstrate,demonstrates,4,"Experiments confirming the role of kin selection in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, which can lead to lower average relatedness between workers.","Experiments confirming the role of kin selection in worker policing demonstrates the effects of multiple matings, which can lead to lower average relatedness between workers.",25,1615,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about experiments related to kin selection and worker policing. 

First, I need to compare the two sentences. The main difference I notice is the verb used: ""demonstrates"" in Sentence A and ""demonstrate"" in Sentence B. The subject of the verb is ""Experiments confirming the role of kin selection in worker policing."" 

Now, the key here is subject-verb agreement. The subject is ""Experiments,"" which is plural. The verb needs to agree with the number of the subject. So, plural subjects take plural verbs. The base form for plural present tense is ""demonstrate,"" while ""demonstrates"" is singular. 

Wait, let me make sure. The structure is ""Experiments... demonstrate/demonstrates."" The word ""confirming"" is a participle phrase modifying ""Experiments,"" but the main verb here is either demonstrate or demonstrates. Since ""Experiments"" is plural, the verb should be ""demonstrate."" Therefore, Sentence B uses the correct plural form, making it grammatical. Sentence A uses ""demonstrates,"" which is singular, so that's incorrect.

But maybe there's a trick here. Could the subject be something else? For example, sometimes intervening phrases can confuse the subject-verb agreement. But in this case, ""confirming the role..."" is a participial phrase that describes the experiments. The head noun is still ""Experiments,"" which is plural. So the verb should definitely be ""demonstrate."" 

Another check: If the sentence started with ""An experiment,"" then ""demonstrates"" would be correct. But since it's ""Experiments,"" plural, ""demonstrate"" is right. 

So Sentence B is correct, Sentence A is incorrect because of the verb agreement. The user might be testing understanding of subject-verb agreement with intervening phrases. It's a common mistake to let the modifying phrase affect the verb choice, but the main subject's number is what determines the verb.
</think>

The grammatical sentence is **Sentence B**, and the ungrammatical one is **Sentence A**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb is ""Experiments"" (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A uses ""**demonstrates**"" (singular), which does not match the plural subject.  
- Sentence B uses ""**demonstrate**"" (plural), which correctly agrees with ""Experiments.""  

**Key Issue:**  
Intervening phrases like ""confirming the role of kin selection in worker policing"" can distract from the main subject (""Experiments""), but the verb must still agree with the plural subject.  

**Corrected Sentence B:**  
*Experiments confirming the role of kin selection in worker policing* **demonstrate** *the effects of multiple matings...*"
17,are,is,4,"Agaritine is a weak carcinogen, however, and estimates for cumulative lifetime risk from mushroom consumption are approximately 1 in 10, 000.","Agaritine is a weak carcinogen, however, and estimates for cumulative lifetime risk from mushroom consumption is approximately 1 in 10, 000.",21,1991,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about agaritine being a weak carcinogen and the risk estimates from mushroom consumption.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used in the second part. Sentence A uses ""are approximately 1 in 10,000,"" while Sentence B uses ""is approximately 1 in 10,000."" 

The subject in the second part of the sentence is ""estimates for cumulative lifetime risk from mushroom consumption."" The key here is determining whether the subject is plural or singular. The word ""estimates"" is plural because it ends with an 's'. So, the verb should agree with that. 

In Sentence A, ""estimates... are"" matches because both are plural. In Sentence B, ""estimates... is"" doesn't agree because ""is"" is singular. That makes Sentence B incorrect. 

Wait, but maybe there's a compound subject or something else? Let me check again. The sentence structure is ""Agaritine is..., and estimates... are/is..."" So, it's two independent clauses joined by ""and."" The first clause is correct with ""is,"" and the second clause's subject is ""estimates,"" which is plural. Therefore, the verb should be ""are."" 

Another thing to consider: sometimes people might confuse the subject with a singular noun that comes after a preposition, like ""risk,"" but here ""estimates"" is the main subject. ""For cumulative lifetime risk from mushroom consumption"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""estimates,"" so it doesn't affect the verb number. 

So, Sentence B is ungrammatical because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject. Sentence A is correct with ""are."" 

I should also check if there are any other issues, like the use of ""however"" with commas. Both sentences have ""however"" set off by commas, which is correct because it's an interrupter. The structure ""Agaritine is a weak carcinogen, however, and..."" is okay. The comma after ""however"" and before ""and"" might be a bit tricky, but since ""however"" is in the middle, the commas are appropriately placed. 

So, the conclusion is that Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is not because of subject-verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The key difference lies in **subject-verb agreement**.  

- In Sentence A:  
  *""estimates for cumulative lifetime risk [...] **are** approximately 1 in 10,000""*  
  The subject **""estimates""** is plural, so the plural verb **""are""** is correct.  

- In Sentence B:  
  *""estimates [...] **is** approximately 1 in 10,000""*  
  The plural subject **""estimates""** incorrectly pairs with the singular verb **""is""**, violating grammatical agreement.  

**Additional Note:**  
Both sentences correctly use commas to set off the interrupter *""however""*. However, Sentence B’s subject-verb error makes it ungrammatical."
17,are,is,4,"Agaritine is a weak carcinogen, however, and estimates for cumulative lifetime risk from mushroom consumption are approximately 1 in 10, 000.","Agaritine is a weak carcinogen, however, and estimates for cumulative lifetime risk from mushroom consumption is approximately 1 in 10, 000.",21,1991,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are almost identical except for the verb ""is"" in sentence A and ""are"" in sentence B. The key difference here is subject-verb agreement.

First, I need to identify the subject in the part of the sentence after ""and"". The phrase is ""estimates for cumulative lifetime risk from mushroom consumption"". The main noun here is ""estimates"", which is plural. So, the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Estimates"" are plural, so the verb should be ""are"" instead of ""is"". 

Wait, but sometimes people might get confused because there's a prepositional phrase after ""estimates"" (""for cumulative lifetime risk...""), which could make someone think the subject is singular. But no, the subject is still ""estimates"", which is plural. So the correct verb should be ""are"". Therefore, sentence B is correct, and sentence A is incorrect because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject.

Let me double-check. If I simplify the sentence: ""Estimates... are approximately 1 in 10,000."" Yes, that sounds right. If it were a singular estimate, it would be ""The estimate is..."", but here it's plural. So yes, sentence B is grammatical, and A is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb in the second clause is **""estimates""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number. Sentence A incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular), while Sentence B correctly uses **""are""** (plural).  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Sentence A:** *""...estimates [...] **is** approximately...""* → **✗ Mismatched subject-verb agreement.**  
- **Sentence B:** *""...estimates [...] **are** approximately...""* → **✓ Correct agreement.**  

The rest of the sentence structure (e.g., punctuation around ""however"") is acceptable in both."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. 

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used: Sentence A uses ""are also available"" while Sentence B uses ""is also available"". The subject in both cases is ""Converters of both the piston type and squeeze type"". 

So, the key here is subject-verb agreement. The subject is ""Converters"", which is plural because it's referring to multiple types of converters (piston and squeeze). In English, plural subjects take plural verbs. The verb in Sentence A is ""are"", which is plural, and in Sentence B it's ""is"", which is singular.

Therefore, Sentence A correctly uses ""are"" to agree with the plural subject ""Converters"". Sentence B incorrectly uses ""is"", which doesn't agree in number with the subject. 

I should also check if there are any other differences, but looking at both sentences, the rest of the structure is the same. The part after ""to allow..."" is the same in both. So the only issue is the verb agreement. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes with ""both... and..."" constructions, the verb should still agree with the subject's number. Since ""converters"" is plural, even though there are two types listed, the verb remains plural. 

So, conclusion: Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is not because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""Converters""** (plural), which requires a plural verb.  
- Sentence A correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to agree with the plural subject.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement.  
**Correction:** ""Converters ... **are** also available"" (not ""is"")."

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb: Sentence A uses ""is"" and Sentence B uses ""are"". 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The subject here is ""Converters of both the piston type and squeeze type"". The word ""converters"" is plural because it's referring to more than one type. So, the verb should agree with a plural subject.

In Sentence A, the verb is ""is"", which is singular. That doesn't match the plural subject ""converters"". That's a problem because subject-verb agreement is essential in English. So Sentence A is likely incorrect.

Sentence B uses ""are"", which is plural. That matches the plural subject, so that should be correct. 

Wait, let me double-check. The structure is ""Converters... are also available"". Yes, ""converters"" is definitely plural. Adding ""both the piston type and squeeze type"" doesn't change the number of the subject; it's still plural. So ""are"" is the correct verb form here. 

Another thing to check: sometimes with ""both... and..."" constructions, the subject remains plural. For example, ""Both the dog and the cat are..."" So in this case, even though there are two types, the main noun is ""converters"", which is plural. So the verb should definitely be ""are"". 

Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""Converters""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb) with the plural subject ""Converters.""  
- Sentence B correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb), ensuring proper subject-verb agreement.  

**Key Issue:**  
Subject-verb agreement. ""Converters"" (plural) requires ""are,"" not ""is."""

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb: ""include"" vs. ""includes"". 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""Other countries with experience in this type of health insurance"". The core noun here is ""countries"", which is plural. So the verb should agree with a plural subject.

Sentence A uses ""include"", which is the plural form. Sentence B uses ""includes"", the singular form. Since the subject is plural, ""include"" should be correct. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is not.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come after the subject. The phrase ""with experience..."" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""countries"". It doesn't change the number of the subject. So the verb still needs to agree with ""countries"", which is plural. So yes, ""include"" is correct.

Another thing to check: the list that follows (China, Taiwan, etc.) are examples of the countries. The verb ""include"" is correct here because the subject is the countries, and the list is the objects being included. 

Also, proper nouns like China, Taiwan should be capitalized. The original sentences have them in lowercase, which is incorrect, but the user's question is about the verb agreement, not the capitalization. So maybe that's a separate issue, but the user didn't mention it. Focus on the verb.

So conclusion: Sentence A is correct, Sentence B is incorrect because of subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: The subject of the sentence is ""Other countries"" (plural), so the verb must agree with a plural subject.  
  - Sentence A correctly uses **""include""** (plural verb form).  
  - Sentence B incorrectly uses **""includes""** (singular verb form), which clashes with the plural subject.  

### Additional Note:  
Proper nouns like *China, Taiwan, Singapore*, and *South Africa* should be capitalized. While this does not affect grammaticality in the strictest sense, it is a writing convention. The core issue here is the verb agreement.  

**Corrected Sentence A:**  
*Other countries with experience in this type of health insurance include China, Taiwan, Singapore, and South Africa.*"
10,include,includes,4,"Other countries with experience in this type of health insurance include china, taiwan, singapore and south africa.","Other countries with experience in this type of health insurance includes china, taiwan, singapore and south africa.",17,2240,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about countries with experience in health insurance, listing some examples. The main difference between them is the verb: ""includes"" in sentence A and ""include"" in sentence B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The subject is ""Other countries with experience in this type of health insurance."" The core noun here is ""countries,"" which is plural. The verb needs to agree with the subject in number. Since ""countries"" is plural, the verb should be plural as well. The plural form of the verb is ""include,"" whereas ""includes"" is singular. 

So, sentence A uses ""includes,"" which is incorrect because the subject is plural. Sentence B uses ""include,"" which is correct. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come after the subject. For example, if the subject had a prepositional phrase that changes the number, but in this case, ""with experience..."" is just modifying ""countries."" The main subject is still ""countries,"" so the verb must agree with that. 

Another thing to check: the list of countries (China, Taiwan, Singapore, South Africa) are examples of the other countries. The verb is not referring to the list but to the subject ""countries."" So the verb should definitely be plural. 

Also, the user might have lowercase letters for the country names, which is incorrect. Proper nouns should be capitalized. But the question is about the verb agreement, not the capitalization. So even if the country names are lowercase, the main issue is the verb. 

So conclusion: Sentence B is correct because ""include"" matches the plural subject ""countries."" Sentence A is incorrect because ""includes"" is singular.
</think>

**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
- The subject of the sentence is **""Other countries""** (plural).  
- The verb must agree with the plural subject, so the correct form is **""include""** (plural), not **""includes""** (singular).  

**Correction:**  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses **""includes""** (singular verb) with a plural subject.  
- Sentence B correctly uses **""include""** (plural verb).  

**Note:** Proper nouns like *China, Taiwan, Singapore*, and *South Africa* should also be capitalized, but the primary grammatical error here is subject-verb agreement."
20,are,is,4,"Except for tippecanoe county, all counties in the state straddling or lying north of 400 30' north latitude are in the diocese.","Except for tippecanoe county, all counties in the state straddling or lying north of 400 30' north latitude is in the diocese.",22,2603,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are about counties in a state and their relation to a diocese. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to identify the subject of the verb. The sentence starts with ""Except for Tippecanoe County,"" which means we're excluding that county. The main clause is ""all counties... are/is in the diocese."" The subject here is ""all counties."" 

Now, ""all counties"" is a plural noun phrase, so the verb should agree with it in number. ""Are"" is the plural form of the verb ""to be,"" and ""is"" is the singular form. Since ""counties"" is plural, the correct verb should be ""are."" That would make Sentence A correct. 

Looking at Sentence B, using ""is"" would be incorrect because the subject is plural. Even though there's a complex prepositional phrase after ""counties"" (""in the state straddling or lying north of 400 30' north latitude""), that doesn't change the subject's plurality. The verb still needs to agree with ""counties,"" not the state or the latitude. 

I should also check if there's any other part of the sentence that might affect subject-verb agreement. The phrase ""straddling or lying north of..."" describes the counties, so it's part of the subject's description but doesn't change the number. The main subject remains ""counties,"" so plural verb is needed. 

Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because it uses the singular ""is"" with a plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb is **""all counties""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A correctly uses **""are""** (plural) to match **""counties""**.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular), which clashes with the plural subject.  

The intervening phrase *""in the state straddling or lying north of 400 30' north latitude""* does not affect the subject-verb agreement. The core structure is:  
*""All counties [...] **are** in the diocese.""*  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: Plural subjects require plural verbs.  
- **Why Sentence B Fails**: *""is""* would only work if the subject were singular (e.g., *""the state""*), but here the subject is explicitly *""counties""*.  

**Correct Sentence (A):**  
*Except for Tippecanoe County, all counties [...] **are** in the diocese.*"
20,are,is,4,"Except for tippecanoe county, all counties in the state straddling or lying north of 400 30' north latitude are in the diocese.","Except for tippecanoe county, all counties in the state straddling or lying north of 400 30' north latitude is in the diocese.",22,2603,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both similar except for the verb: ""is"" in A and ""are"" in B.

First, I need to identify the subject of the verb. The main clause in both sentences starts with ""all counties..."". The subject here is ""all counties"", which is plural. The verb that follows should agree with the subject in number. 

In sentence A, the verb is ""is"", which is singular. That doesn't match the plural subject ""counties"". So that's a problem. Sentence B uses ""are"", which is plural, so that should be correct. 

Wait, let me double-check. The structure is ""Except for Tippecanoe County, all counties... are in the diocese."" The phrase ""Except for Tippecanoe County"" is a prepositional phrase that doesn't affect the subject-verb agreement. The main subject is still ""all counties"", so the verb needs to be plural. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes with phrases like ""along with"" or ""as well as"", the verb agrees with the main subject, but in this case, ""except for"" is just setting aside one county, so the main subject remains plural. 

So sentence A is incorrect because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject. Sentence B is correct with ""are"".
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
The subject of the verb in both sentences is **""all counties""** (plural). Therefore, the verb must agree in number with the plural subject.  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses the singular verb **""is""** (*""all counties ... is""*), which does not match the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses the plural verb **""are""** (*""all counties ... are""*), ensuring subject-verb agreement.  

The phrase *""straddling or lying north of 400 30' north latitude""* is a modifier and does not affect the grammatical number of the subject. The core structure remains:  
*""All counties ... are in the diocese.""*  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Plural subjects require plural verbs. ""All counties"" (plural) ➔ ""are"" (plural verb)."
18,are,is,4,"Building and removal businesses, which were to a great extent bound to the stone quarrying industry, are nevertheless still in business now.","Building and removal businesses, which were to a great extent bound to the stone quarrying industry, is nevertheless still in business now.",22,3062,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about building and removal businesses related to the stone quarrying industry. 

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used in the main clause. Sentence A uses ""are"" while Sentence B uses ""is"". The subject here is ""Building and removal businesses"", which is plural because it's two different types of businesses combined with ""and"". 

In English, when the subject is plural, the verb must agree in number. So plural subjects take plural verbs. ""Are"" is the plural form of ""to be"", and ""is"" is singular. Therefore, the main clause in Sentence A has ""are"" which matches the plural subject. Sentence B uses ""is"", which is singular, so that would be incorrect.

But wait, there's a relative clause in the middle: ""which were to a great extent bound to the stone quarrying industry"". The relative pronoun ""which"" refers back to the businesses, so the verb in the relative clause is ""were"", which is plural. That's correct because the antecedent is plural. So both sentences have the correct verb in the relative clause. 

The problem is definitely in the main clause. The main subject is ""Building and removal businesses"", so the verb should be ""are"" as in Sentence A. Sentence B incorrectly uses ""is"", which doesn't agree with the plural subject. 

I should also check if there's any other part of the sentence that might affect subject-verb agreement. The phrase ""to a great extent"" is an adverbial phrase and doesn't change the number of the subject. The adverb ""nevertheless"" and the time phrase ""still in business now"" also don't affect the verb form. 

So, conclusion: Sentence A is correct because the plural subject takes ""are"". Sentence B is incorrect because ""is"" is singular, which doesn't match the plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject ""Building and removal businesses"" is plural, so the verb in the main clause must agree with it.  
- Sentence A correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), which clashes with the plural subject.  

The relative clause (""which were..."") is correctly plural in both sentences (""were"" matches ""businesses""), but the error in Sentence B lies in the main clause's verb agreement."
18,are,is,4,"Building and removal businesses, which were to a great extent bound to the stone quarrying industry, are nevertheless still in business now.","Building and removal businesses, which were to a great extent bound to the stone quarrying industry, is nevertheless still in business now.",22,3062,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about building and removal businesses related to the stone quarrying industry. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""Building and removal businesses,"" which is plural because it's two different types of businesses combined. So, the verb should agree with a plural subject. ""Are"" is the plural form, and ""is"" is singular. That makes me think Sentence B is correct because it uses ""are,"" matching the plural subject.

But wait, let me double-check. The sentence structure has a relative clause: ""which were to a great extent bound to the stone quarrying industry."" The verb in the relative clause is ""were,"" which is plural, so that's consistent with the plural subject. Then the main clause's verb is either ""is"" or ""are."" Since the main subject is still ""businesses,"" which is plural, the correct verb should be ""are."" So Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is wrong because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject.

Another thing to consider: sometimes compound subjects can be tricky. If the subject were a single entity, like ""Building and removal business"" (singular), then ""is"" would be correct. But here it's ""businesses,"" plural. So yes, ""are"" is right. The user might be testing knowledge of subject-verb agreement, especially with intervening clauses. The relative clause might distract someone, but the main verb must still agree with the original subject. 

So, conclusion: Sentence B is grammatical, Sentence A is not because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""Building and removal businesses,"" which is plural. The verb must agree in number with the subject.  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses the singular verb ""is"" (""...is nevertheless still in business now""), which clashes with the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses the plural verb ""are"" (""...are nevertheless still in business now""), matching the plural subject.  

The relative clause (""which were..."") does not affect the agreement between the main subject and verb. Thus, **Sentence B** is grammatically correct."
14,are,is,4,Reflections in a plane combined with translation in that plane by the same distance are in the same class.,Reflections in a plane combined with translation in that plane by the same distance is in the same class.,19,3830,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about reflections and translations in a plane. Hmm.

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B. The subject of the sentence is ""Reflections in a plane combined with translation in that plane by the same distance."" So, the key here is to determine whether the subject is plural or singular, which will dictate if the verb should be ""are"" or ""is.""

Let me break down the subject. The main noun is ""Reflections,"" which is plural. Then there's a modifier: ""in a plane combined with translation in that plane by the same distance."" The phrase ""combined with translation..."" is adding another element to the subject. But when you use ""combined with,"" does that make the subject singular or plural? I remember that when you have a subject with ""along with,"" ""as well as,"" or ""combined with,"" the verb agrees with the main subject. So, since the main subject is ""Reflections"" (plural), the verb should remain plural, regardless of the additional elements. Therefore, ""are"" would be correct here.

In Sentence B, using ""is"" would be incorrect because the main subject is plural. Even though there's a combination with another noun (""translation""), the verb still needs to agree with the plural ""Reflections."" So Sentence A should be correct, and Sentence B is incorrect.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes, when two subjects are combined, even with ""and,"" the verb becomes plural. But here it's ""combined with,"" which is more like a parenthetical or additive phrase, not a conjunction. So the rule is that the verb agrees with the first subject. For example, ""The teacher, along with her students, is going to the museum."" Here, ""teacher"" is singular, so ""is"" is correct. Similarly, in our case, ""Reflections... combined with translation..."" – ""Reflections"" is plural, so the verb should be plural. Therefore, ""are"" is correct. So Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is not.

Another way to test this is to simplify the sentence. Remove the additional phrases: ""Reflections are in the same class."" That's correct. If we used ""is,"" it would be ""Reflections is..."" which is wrong. So the core subject-verb agreement is correct in A, incorrect in B.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""Reflections"" (plural), modified by the phrase ""combined with translation..."" The verb must agree with the plural noun ""Reflections."" The phrase ""combined with translation"" does not alter the plurality of the subject; it functions as a non-essential addition. Thus, the plural verb ""**are**"" (Sentence A) is correct.  

In Sentence B, the singular verb ""**is**"" incorrectly matches the plural subject ""Reflections,"" making it ungrammatical.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
When a subject is plural, subsequent phrases like ""combined with,"" ""along with,"" or ""as well as"" do not change its plurality. The verb must agree with the original plural subject."
14,are,is,4,Reflections in a plane combined with translation in that plane by the same distance are in the same class.,Reflections in a plane combined with translation in that plane by the same distance is in the same class.,19,3830,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which of these two sentences is grammatical. Let's look at them again.

Sentence A: ""Reflections in a plane combined with translation in that plane by the same distance is in the same class.""

Sentence B: ""Reflections in a plane combined with translation in that plane by the same distance are in the same class.""

The main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" vs. ""are"". So the question is whether the subject is singular or plural. 

The subject here is ""Reflections in a plane combined with translation in that plane by the same distance."" Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let's break it down. The main noun is ""Reflections"", which is plural. Then there's ""combined with translation..."". The phrase ""combined with"" might be acting like a preposition here, similar to ""along with"" or ""as well as"". In grammar, when you have a subject with a plural noun followed by ""along with"" another noun, the verb still agrees with the main subject, which is plural. So in that case, the verb should be plural. 

For example, ""The teacher along with the students is/are going to the museum."" Here, ""the teacher"" is singular, so even though there's ""along with the students"", the verb should be ""is"". But in our case, the main subject is ""Reflections"", which is plural. So even though it's combined with ""translation"", which is singular, the verb should still be plural. So ""are"" would be correct. 

Wait, but maybe ""combined with"" is acting differently here. Let me think. If the subject is ""Reflections combined with translation"", does that make it a compound subject? Like ""Reflections and translation are...""? If that's the case, then the verb should be plural. But if ""combined with"" is not creating a compound subject but rather adding something to the reflections, then the verb might still agree with the main noun. 

But in standard grammar, ""combined with"" doesn't make a compound subject. So the main subject is ""Reflections"", and ""combined with translation..."" is a prepositional phrase modifying it. Therefore, the verb should agree with ""Reflections"", which is plural. So Sentence B with ""are"" is correct. 

But wait, maybe the combination of reflections and translation is considered a single concept, making it singular. For example, ""Peanut butter and jelly is my favorite sandwich."" Here, even though there are two nouns, they're treated as a singular concept. But in the given sentences, the context is about reflections and translation being in the same class. If they are considered together as a single operation, maybe ""is"" is correct. But I think in mathematical contexts, when you combine two operations, they might still be considered plural unless they form a specific named group. 

Alternatively, maybe the sentence is trying to say that each reflection combined with a translation is in the same class. But the way it's phrased, ""Reflections... combined with translation... are in the same class."" So each reflection, when combined with a translation, is in the same class. But if the subject is plural, then ""are"" is needed. 

Alternatively, maybe the combination is singular. For example, ""A reflection combined with a translation is..."" but here the subject is ""Reflections... combined with translation"", which is plural. So I think the correct verb is ""are"". Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject.
</think>

The grammatical sentence is **Sentence B**, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   The subject of the sentence is **""Reflections... combined with translation...""**.  
   - The main noun is **""Reflections""** (plural).  
   - The phrase **""combined with translation...""** acts as a modifier, not part of the subject.  
   - In English, modifiers like ""combined with"" do not change the number of the subject. The verb must agree with the main noun (**""Reflections""**), which is plural.  

   Thus, **""are""** (plural verb) is correct in Sentence B, while **""is""** (singular verb) in Sentence A is incorrect.

2. **Contextual Clarity**:  
   Even if the combination of reflections and translation were treated as a singular concept (e.g., a specific symmetry operation), the phrasing **""Reflections... are in the same class""** still aligns with standard mathematical terminology, where multiple instances of a combined operation would typically be plural.  

**Final Answer**:  
- **Sentence B** is grammatical.  
- **Sentence A** is ungrammatical."
12,are,is,4,Plaques dedicating the pavement completion and describing the significance of this segment are on display at the rest area.,Plaques dedicating the pavement completion and describing the significance of this segment is on display at the rest area.,19,3930,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Both are about plaques dedicating pavement completion and describing their significance, displayed at a rest area. The difference between them is the verb: Sentence A uses ""are"" and Sentence B uses ""is"". 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The subject here is ""plaques"", which is plural. The verb must agree with the subject in number. So, plural subjects take plural verbs. ""Are"" is the plural form of ""to be"", and ""is"" is singular. 

Looking at Sentence A: ""Plaques... are on display."" Since ""plaques"" is plural, ""are"" is correct. Sentence B uses ""is"", which is singular, so that would be incorrect. 

Wait, but maybe there's a compound subject or something else that could affect the verb? Let me check the structure again. The subject is ""plaques"", and then there are two participial phrases: ""dedicating the pavement completion"" and ""describing the significance..."". These phrases modify ""plaques"" but don't change the number of the subject. So the main clause is ""Plaques... are on display..."". 

So yes, Sentence A is correct because the plural subject ""plaques"" requires the plural verb ""are"". Sentence B incorrectly uses ""is"", which doesn't agree with the plural subject. 

I should also consider if there's any other grammatical issue, but the main difference is the verb agreement. The rest of the sentence structure seems the same. So the answer is that Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical due to subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of both sentences is **""plaques""** (plural). The verb must agree in number with the subject.  

- Sentence A correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), which does not agree with the plural subject ""plaques.""  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both about plaques on display. The main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to identify the subject of each sentence. The subject here is ""Plaques,"" which is plural. The verb must agree with the subject in number. Since ""plaques"" is plural, the verb should also be plural. ""Are"" is the plural form of ""to be,"" while ""is"" is singular. 

Looking at Sentence A: ""Plaques... is on display."" That doesn't sound right because the plural subject ""plaques"" is paired with the singular verb ""is."" That's a subject-verb agreement error. 

Sentence B uses ""are,"" which matches the plural subject. So ""Plaques... are on display"" is correct. 

I should also check if there are any other parts of the sentence that might affect this. The phrases ""dedicating the pavement completion"" and ""describing the significance..."" are participial phrases modifying ""plaques,"" but they don't change the number of the subject. The main clause is still about the plaques, so the verb must agree with that. 

Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""plaques"" (plural), so the verb must agree in number. Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb ""is,"" while Sentence B correctly uses the plural verb ""are.""  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement:** ""Plaques"" (plural) requires ""are"" (plural verb), not ""is"" (singular verb).  
- **Phrases like ""dedicating..."" and ""describing...""** are participial modifiers and do not affect the number of the subject.  

**Correct Sentence (B):**  
*Plaques dedicating the pavement completion and describing the significance of this segment **are** on display at the rest area.*"
12,make,makes,4,"Dahl states that difference in size, diversity, and economic affluence make attributing good performance on these measures to government effectiveness too difficult.","Dahl states that difference in size, diversity, and economic affluence makes attributing good performance on these measures to government effectiveness too difficult.",22,4857,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are very similar, but there's a difference in the verb used: ""make"" in Sentence A and ""makes"" in Sentence B. The subject that these verbs are referring to is ""difference in size, diversity, and economic affluence."" 

First, I need to figure out whether the subject is singular or plural. The main noun here is ""difference,"" which is singular. However, the sentence lists multiple factors after ""difference"": size, diversity, and economic affluence. This might make someone think that the subject is plural because there are three items listed. But actually, the structure is ""difference in [three things],"" so the subject is still ""difference,"" which is singular. 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""make,"" which is plural. But since the subject is singular, that would be incorrect. Sentence B uses ""makes,"" which is singular, so that should be correct. Wait, but sometimes when you have a list following a singular noun with prepositions, people might get confused. Let me check again.

The phrase ""difference in size, diversity, and economic affluence"" – the word ""difference"" is modified by the prepositional phrase starting with ""in."" The items listed (size, diversity, affluence) are objects of the preposition ""in,"" so they don't affect the number of the subject. The subject is still ""difference,"" singular. Therefore, the verb should be singular ""makes."" So Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect because it uses the plural verb ""make"" with a singular subject.

But wait, maybe there's a case where the items in the list could be considered part of the subject. Let me think. If the sentence were ""Differences in size, diversity, and economic affluence make...,"" then ""differences"" would be plural, and ""make"" would be correct. But here it's ""difference,"" singular. So the verb must agree with ""difference,"" hence ""makes."" 

Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical because of subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the clause is *""difference in size, diversity, and economic affluence.""* The core noun here is **""difference""** (singular), and the prepositional phrase *""in size, diversity, and economic affluence""* modifies it. Since the subject is singular, the verb must agree with it in number.  

- Sentence A incorrectly uses **""make""** (plural verb), which clashes with the singular subject.  
- Sentence B correctly uses **""makes""** (singular verb), matching the singular subject ""difference.""  

The confusion often arises because the prepositional phrase includes a list of plural nouns (*size, diversity, affluence*), but these do not affect the grammatical number of the subject. The verb must agree with the head noun (*difference*), not the objects in the prepositional phrase."
12,make,makes,4,"Dahl states that difference in size, diversity, and economic affluence make attributing good performance on these measures to government effectiveness too difficult.","Dahl states that difference in size, diversity, and economic affluence makes attributing good performance on these measures to government effectiveness too difficult.",22,4857,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both starting with ""Dahl states that difference in size, diversity, and economic affluence..."" and then differing in the verb ""makes"" vs. ""make"". 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the verb in question. The main clause is ""Dahl states that..."", so the focus is on the subordinate clause starting with ""that"". The subject of the verb ""makes/make"" is ""difference in size, diversity, and economic affluence"". 

Wait, the subject here is ""difference"". The phrase ""in size, diversity, and economic affluence"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""difference"". So the main noun is ""difference"", which is singular. Therefore, the verb should agree with a singular subject. That would mean ""makes"" is correct.

But wait, the user might be confused because there are multiple items listed after ""difference in..."". Let me check again. The structure is ""difference in [size, diversity, and economic affluence]"". The word ""difference"" is singular, so the verb should be singular. So sentence A uses ""makes"", which is singular, and sentence B uses ""make"", plural. Therefore, sentence A should be correct.

But maybe the user is thinking that the subject is the list of items (size, diversity, etc.), but no, the subject is ""difference"", which is modified by the prepositional phrase. So the verb must agree with ""difference"", not the items in the list. 

Therefore, sentence A is grammatical, and sentence B is ungrammatical because it uses the plural verb ""make"" with a singular subject ""difference"".
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb ""makes/make"" is the singular noun **""difference""** (modified by the prepositional phrase *""in size, diversity, and economic affluence""*). Since ""difference"" is singular, it requires the singular verb **""makes""** (Sentence A).  

Sentence B incorrectly uses the plural verb **""make""**, which does not agree with the singular subject ""difference."" The list of items (*size, diversity, economic affluence*) is part of the prepositional phrase describing the *type* of difference, not the subject itself.  

Thus:  
- ✅ **Sentence A**: Correct (singular subject + singular verb).  
- ❌ **Sentence B**: Incorrect (singular subject + plural verb)."
11,is,are,4,The key difference between persistent data structures and retroactive data structures is how they handle the element of time.,The key difference between persistent data structures and retroactive data structures are how they handle the element of time.,19,4933,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are about the difference between persistent and retroactive data structures, focusing on how they handle time.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. Let's look at the sentences again.

Sentence A: ""The key difference ... is how they handle..."" 
Sentence B: ""The key difference ... are how they handle...""

The subject here is ""The key difference,"" which is singular. The verb in question is ""is"" versus ""are."" Since ""difference"" is singular, the verb should be singular as well. So ""is"" would be correct. That makes Sentence A correct and Sentence B incorrect.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused when the predicate is a clause. The complement after the verb is ""how they handle the element of time,"" which is a clause starting with ""how."" Even though ""they handle"" uses a plural verb, the subject of the main clause is still ""difference,"" which is singular. So the verb should agree with ""difference,"" not the complement. 

Another way to check is to reverse the sentence. If you say ""How they handle the element of time is the key difference,"" the verb ""is"" still agrees with the singular subject ""the key difference."" So even in that structure, it's ""is."" Therefore, Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is wrong because it uses ""are"" with a singular subject.

I should also consider if there's any exception or tricky part here. Sometimes, when the subject is a collective noun or when there's a phrase between the subject and verb, people might make mistakes. But in this case, ""between persistent data structures and retroactive data structures"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""difference,"" so it doesn't affect the verb. The core subject is still ""difference,"" which is singular. 

So, yes, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical due to subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""The key difference,"" which is singular. The verb must agree with the singular subject, so ""**is**"" (singular) is correct. Sentence B incorrectly uses ""**are**"" (plural), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

**Key Rule:**  
- Singular subject → singular verb (*difference **is***).  
- Plural subject → plural verb (*differences **are***).  

The phrase ""how they handle the element of time"" acts as a predicate noun clause and does not affect the verb agreement. Sentence A follows this rule correctly."
11,is,are,4,The key difference between persistent data structures and retroactive data structures is how they handle the element of time.,The key difference between persistent data structures and retroactive data structures are how they handle the element of time.,19,4933,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. The sentences are about the difference between persistent and retroactive data structures, focusing on how they handle time.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""the key difference,"" which is singular. The verb should agree with the subject in number. Sentence A uses ""are,"" which is plural, while Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is singular. So, the verb in Sentence A doesn't match the singular subject. That makes me think Sentence B is correct.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused when there's a prepositional phrase after the subject. The sentence structure is ""The key difference between X and Y is/are..."" The subject is ""difference,"" not the nouns in the prepositional phrase. So even though there are two data structures mentioned, the subject remains singular. Therefore, ""is"" is correct. 

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. Remove the prepositional phrases: ""The key difference [...] is how they handle time."" That sounds right. If I use ""are,"" it would be ""The key difference are..."" which clearly doesn't sound right. 

So, Sentence B is grammatical because the singular subject ""difference"" takes the singular verb ""is."" Sentence A is incorrect because it uses the plural verb ""are"" with a singular subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""The key difference""* (singular), so the verb must agree in number. Sentence A incorrectly uses the plural verb *""are""*, while Sentence B correctly uses the singular verb *""is""*.  

The confusion often arises because the prepositional phrase *""between persistent data structures and retroactive data structures""* (plural) follows the subject, but the verb must still agree with the singular subject *""difference""*.  

**Correct Structure:**  
*The key difference [...] **is** how they handle [...] time.*"
13,include,includes,4,"Disciplines in which one might use the word formulation in the abstract sense include logic, mathematics, linguistics, legal theory, and computer science.","Disciplines in which one might use the word formulation in the abstract sense includes logic, mathematics, linguistics, legal theory, and computer science.",22,4963,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both listing disciplines where the word ""formulation"" is used abstractly. The difference between them is the verb: Sentence A uses ""include"" and Sentence B uses ""includes"". 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the verb. The main clause in both sentences starts with ""Disciplines... include(s)..."". The subject here is ""Disciplines"", which is plural. The verb should agree with the subject in number. Since ""disciplines"" is plural, the verb should be ""include"" without the ""s"". So Sentence A uses ""include"", which is correct for a plural subject. Sentence B uses ""includes"", which is singular, so that would be incorrect.

Wait, but maybe the user is confused because the list that follows is a series of singular nouns: logic, mathematics, etc. But the verb isn't agreeing with the list; it's agreeing with the subject ""disciplines"". The list is the object of the verb. So the verb ""include"" is correct because the subject is plural. 

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. If I remove the relative clause, it becomes ""Disciplines include..."". That's clearly correct. If I tried ""Disciplines includes..."", that's wrong. So Sentence B is ungrammatical because the verb doesn't agree with the plural subject. 

I should also consider if there's any other part of the sentence that might affect subject-verb agreement. The relative clause ""in which one might use the word formulation in the abstract sense"" is modifying ""disciplines"", but it doesn't change the number of the subject. The main subject is still ""disciplines"", so the verb must be plural. 

Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A is grammatical.**  
- **Sentence B is ungrammatical.**  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the verb is ""disciplines,"" which is plural. The verb must agree in number with its subject, so the plural form **""include""** (Sentence A) is correct. Sentence B incorrectly uses the singular verb **""includes""** with the plural subject ""disciplines,"" making it ungrammatical.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
Subject-verb agreement requires that a plural subject (e.g., ""disciplines"") pairs with a plural verb (e.g., ""include""), while a singular subject pairs with a singular verb."
13,include,includes,4,"Disciplines in which one might use the word formulation in the abstract sense include logic, mathematics, linguistics, legal theory, and computer science.","Disciplines in which one might use the word formulation in the abstract sense includes logic, mathematics, linguistics, legal theory, and computer science.",22,4963,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are about disciplines where the word ""formulation"" is used in an abstract sense. The main difference between them is the verb: ""includes"" in Sentence A and ""include"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The subject here is ""Disciplines,"" which is plural. The verb needs to agree with the subject in number. So, plural subjects take plural verbs. ""Include"" is the plural form, while ""includes"" is singular. Therefore, Sentence B uses ""include,"" which matches the plural subject ""Disciplines,"" making it correct. Sentence A uses ""includes,"" which is singular, so that would be incorrect because the subject is plural.

Wait, but sometimes there can be tricky cases where the subject isn't immediately before the verb. Let me check the structure again. The sentence starts with ""Disciplines in which..."" and then the verb comes after ""abstract sense."" The main clause is ""Disciplines... include..."" So the subject is definitely ""Disciplines,"" plural. Therefore, the verb should be ""include."" So Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is wrong because it uses the singular verb ""includes"" with a plural subject.

Another way to test this is to simplify the sentence. Remove the prepositional phrases and modifiers: ""Disciplines include..."" vs. ""Disciplines includes..."" Clearly, ""include"" is correct here. So yes, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical due to subject-verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Disciplines""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number. The plural verb **""include""** (Sentence B) correctly matches the plural subject. Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb **""includes""**, which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
Subject-verb agreement requires that singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs. Here, ""disciplines"" (plural) → ""include"" (plural)."
15,have,has,4,"However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ and they have different needs for staying in a country.","However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ and they has different needs for staying in a country.",22,5041,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Both look very similar except for the verb in the last part: ""have"" vs. ""has"". 

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs. So, let's break down the sentences.

Looking at Sentence A: ""...they have different needs..."" The pronoun here is ""they"", which is plural. The verb ""have"" is the base form used with plural subjects. That seems correct. 

Sentence B: ""...they has different needs..."" Here, ""has"" is the third person singular form (he/she/it has). But ""they"" is plural, so using ""has"" would be incorrect. That makes Sentence B ungrammatical.

Wait, but maybe there's something else I'm missing. Let me check the entire sentence structure. The subject in the second part is ""they"", which refers back to ""criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim"". Wait, ""criteria"" is actually plural (the singular is ""criterion""), so the subject is plural. Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" correctly refers to a plural subject, and the verb should be ""have"". 

So yes, Sentence A is correct because ""they have"" matches the plural subject. Sentence B uses ""has"", which is singular, so it's incorrect. 

I should also check if there are any other issues in the sentences, but the main difference is the verb. The rest of the structure seems the same. So the conclusion is that Sentence A is grammatical, Sentence B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The error lies in the subject-verb agreement in the second clause:  
- In **Sentence A**, the plural pronoun *""they""* correctly pairs with the plural verb *""have""* (**they have**).  
- In **Sentence B**, *""they has""* is incorrect because *""has""* is the third-person singular form of the verb (*he/she/it has*), which clashes with the plural subject *""they""*.  

The rest of both sentences is structurally identical and grammatically sound. The key issue is the mismatch between the plural subject (*they*) and the singular verb (*has*) in Sentence B."
15,have,has,4,"However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ and they have different needs for staying in a country.","However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ and they has different needs for staying in a country.",22,5041,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb used after ""they"": ""has"" in sentence A and ""have"" in sentence B.

First, I need to recall subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""they,"" which is a plural pronoun. The verb that follows should agree in number. ""Has"" is the third person singular form of ""to have,"" while ""have"" is used for plural subjects. So ""they have"" is correct because ""they"" is plural. Therefore, sentence B uses the correct verb form. 

Looking at sentence A, ""they has"" is incorrect because ""has"" doesn't match the plural subject. That makes sentence A ungrammatical. The rest of both sentences seem okay. The criteria differ, and the needs are different. The structure after the conjunction ""and"" is parallel. So the only error is in the verb agreement in sentence A. 

I should also check if there's any other possible issue, like the antecedent of ""they."" In both sentences, ""they"" refers back to ""a refugee and a trafficking victim,"" which are singular nouns. Wait, that might be a problem. If ""they"" refers to two singular nouns, does that make it plural? Yes, because when you have two singular nouns joined by ""and,"" the pronoun becomes plural. So ""they"" is correctly plural here. Therefore, the verb should indeed be ""have."" 

So sentence B is correct, and sentence A is incorrect because of the verb ""has."" The user might be confused about subject-verb agreement, especially when the subject is a pronoun referring to multiple entities. It's important to note that even though ""a refugee and a trafficking victim"" are each singular, together they form a plural subject, hence ""they have.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The error lies in the subject-verb agreement in the phrase *""they has different needs""* (Sentence A). The pronoun *""they""* is plural, so it requires the plural verb *""have""* (as in Sentence B). The singular verb *""has""* is incorrect here.  

**Key Details:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement:** *""They""* (plural) must pair with *""have""* (plural), not *""has""* (singular).  
- **Clarity:** Both sentences correctly use *""criteria ... differ""* (plural subject/verb agreement), but Sentence A fails at *""they has.""*  

Sentence B is correct:  
*""However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ, and they **have** different needs for staying in a country.""*"
14,pass,passes,4,"Most high-energy particles, beside displacing carbon atom from the lattice site, also pass it enough surplus energy for a rapid migration through the lattice.","Most high-energy particles, beside displacing carbon atom from the lattice site, also passes it enough surplus energy for a rapid migration through the lattice.",24,5493,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. Both sentences are about high-energy particles displacing carbon atoms and transferring energy. The main difference between them is the verb used in the second part: ""pass"" versus ""passes."" 

First, I need to check the subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""Most high-energy particles,"" which is plural. The verb that follows should agree with a plural subject. In sentence A, the verb is ""pass,"" which is the base form used with plural subjects. In sentence B, it's ""passes,"" which is the third person singular form. Since the subject is plural, ""passes"" would be incorrect. So sentence B has a subject-verb agreement error.

Next, I should look at other parts of the sentences for any issues. The phrase ""beside displacing carbon atom"" catches my eye. The noun ""atom"" here is singular, but when talking about displacing atoms in a lattice, it's more common to use the plural form ""atoms"" because there are multiple atoms involved. So both sentences might have an issue with ""carbon atom"" instead of ""carbon atoms."" However, the user is specifically asking about the grammaticality between A and B, so maybe that's a separate point but still worth mentioning.

Also, the pronoun ""it"" is used in both sentences. The antecedent for ""it"" should be ""carbon atom,"" which is singular. But if ""carbon atom"" is plural, then ""them"" would be correct. However, since the original sentences use ""it,"" there's a possible agreement issue between ""carbon atom"" (singular) and ""it"" (singular) versus the context implying multiple atoms. But again, the main difference between A and B is the verb ""pass"" vs. ""passes,"" so that's the key point.

So, putting it all together: Sentence B is ungrammatical because ""passes"" doesn't agree with the plural subject ""particles."" Sentence A uses ""pass,"" which is correct. However, both sentences have an issue with ""carbon atom"" needing to be plural. But since the user is focusing on A vs. B, the main answer is about the verb agreement. I should note the other issue as an additional point but clarify that the primary error is in the verb.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

### Key Reasons:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - The subject of the sentence is **""Most high-energy particles""** (plural).  
   - In Sentence A, the verb **""pass""** correctly agrees with the plural subject.  
   - In Sentence B, **""passes""** (singular) incorrectly disagrees with the plural subject.  

2. **Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement**:  
   - The pronoun **""it""** refers to **""carbon atom""** (singular), which is grammatically consistent in both sentences. However, this phrasing is slightly awkward because displacing a single ""carbon atom"" in a lattice is contextually unusual (plural ""atoms"" would be more logical).  

3. **Minor Issue in Both Sentences**:  
   - **""carbon atom""** should likely be pluralized to **""carbon atoms""** in both sentences, as particles would displace multiple atoms in a lattice. However, this does not affect the grammaticality distinction between A and B.  

### Conclusion:  
Sentence B is ungrammatical due to the singular verb **""passes""** mismatching the plural subject. Sentence A is correct in this regard. Both sentences would benefit from revising **""carbon atom""** to **""carbon atoms""** for clarity and scientific accuracy."
14,pass,passes,4,"Most high-energy particles, beside displacing carbon atom from the lattice site, also pass it enough surplus energy for a rapid migration through the lattice.","Most high-energy particles, beside displacing carbon atom from the lattice site, also passes it enough surplus energy for a rapid migration through the lattice.",24,5493,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. Both sentences are very similar, but there's a difference in the verb ""passes"" versus ""pass."" I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I'll read both sentences carefully. Sentence A uses ""passes,"" and Sentence B uses ""pass."" The subject here is ""Most high-energy particles."" The main clause in both sentences is about these particles doing something: passing surplus energy. 

Now, the key is subject-verb agreement. The subject is plural because ""most"" is used with a plural noun. ""Most particles"" are plural, so the verb should agree with that. Let's check the verbs. 

In Sentence A: ""also passes it enough surplus energy..."" The verb here is ""passes,"" which is third person singular. But the subject is plural, so that's a problem. The correct verb should be ""pass"" without the -s. 

In Sentence B: ""also pass it enough surplus energy..."" Here, ""pass"" is the plural form, which matches the plural subject ""particles."" So Sentence B should be correct. 

Wait, but let me double-check. The sentence structure might be a bit tricky because of the interrupting phrase. The main clause is ""Most high-energy particles... also pass..."" The part between the commas is a parenthetical phrase, so the verb still needs to agree with ""particles."" Yes, so ""pass"" is correct. 

Another thing to check: ""beside displacing carbon atom..."" Shouldn't that be ""a carbon atom"" or ""carbon atoms""? Because ""displacing carbon atom"" without an article or plural sounds off. But the user is only asking about the verb agreement between A and B. So maybe that's a separate issue, but the main focus is on ""passes"" vs. ""pass."" 

So, conclusion: Sentence B is grammatical because the plural subject requires the plural verb ""pass."" Sentence A uses the singular ""passes,"" which doesn't agree with the plural subject, making it ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Most high-energy particles""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses **""passes""** (singular), which clashes with the plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses **""pass""** (plural), matching the plural subject.  

**Additional Issues (not asked, but worth noting):**  
- **""carbon atom""** should be pluralized (**""carbon atoms""**) or preceded by an article (**""a carbon atom""**) to be grammatically correct.  
- **""beside""** might be better replaced with **""besides""** (meaning ""in addition to""), depending on the intended meaning.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Subject-verb agreement is the critical factor here. Plural subjects require plural verbs."

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: Sentence A or Sentence B. The sentences are about the interval between stadia marks in instruments and the stadia interval factor. 

First, I need to remember the basic subject-verb agreement rules. The subject here is ""the interval,"" which is singular. The verb in question is either ""gives"" (Sentence A) or ""give"" (Sentence B). Since ""interval"" is singular, the verb should agree with it. So, ""gives"" would be correct.

But wait, let me make sure there's no tricky part here. The phrase ""between stadia marks in most stadia instruments"" is a prepositional phrase modifying the subject. Sometimes, people get confused when there's a prepositional phrase between the subject and verb, but the verb should still agree with the main subject, not the object of the preposition. In this case, ""stadia marks"" is plural, but the subject is still ""interval,"" so the verb remains singular. 

So Sentence A uses ""gives,"" which is correct for a singular subject. Sentence B uses ""give,"" which is plural, so it doesn't agree with the singular subject. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical. 

I should also check if there's any other possible confusion. For example, maybe ""stadia"" is being used in a way that affects the number. But ""stadia"" here is an adjective modifying ""marks"" and ""instruments,"" so it doesn't change the subject-verb agreement. The core of the sentence is still ""interval gives."" 

Another thing to consider: sometimes collective nouns or nouns that seem plural but are singular can trip people up. But ""interval"" is clearly singular. So no issues there. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that Sentence A is correct, and Sentence B is incorrect because of the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""**the interval**,"" which is singular. The verb must agree with the singular subject, so ""**gives**"" (singular) is correct. Sentence B incorrectly uses ""**give**"" (plural), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

The prepositional phrase ""between stadia marks in most stadia instruments"" does not affect the grammatical number of the subject. The core structure is:  
*The interval [...] **gives** a stadia interval factor of 100.*  

Thus, Sentence A follows proper subject-verb agreement, while Sentence B does not."
9,gives,give,4,The interval between stadia marks in most stadia instruments gives a stadia interval factor of 100.,The interval between stadia marks in most stadia instruments give a stadia interval factor of 100.,16,5494,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. The main difference between them is the verb: ""give"" vs. ""gives"". 

First, I need to figure out the subject of the sentence. The sentence structure is ""The interval between stadia marks... give/gives a stadia interval factor..."" So the subject is ""The interval"". ""Between stadia marks"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""interval"", and ""in most stadia instruments"" is another prepositional phrase. So the main subject is singular: ""interval"".

In English, the verb must agree with the subject in number. Since ""interval"" is singular, the verb should be singular as well. That would be ""gives"" instead of ""give"". So sentence B uses ""gives"", which is correct. Sentence A uses ""give"", which is plural, so it doesn't agree with the singular subject. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused with phrases that come after the subject. For example, if the subject were ""marks"", which is plural, then ""give"" would be correct. But here, the subject is ""interval"", not ""marks"". The prepositional phrases ""between stadia marks"" and ""in most stadia instruments"" are just providing more information about the interval. So the verb should definitely be ""gives"".

So sentence B is correct, and sentence A is incorrect because of subject-verb disagreement. The user might be confused because of the plural noun ""marks"" nearby, but the actual subject is singular. I should explain that clearly, pointing out the subject and why the verb needs to agree with it. Also, maybe mention the common mistake of being misled by prepositional phrases that come after the subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is *""The interval""* (singular). The verb must agree with the singular subject, so the correct form is **""gives""** (singular) rather than **""give""** (plural).  

The confusion often arises because the prepositional phrases *""between stadia marks""* and *""in most stadia instruments""* might mistakenly draw attention to plural nouns (*marks, instruments*). However, these phrases only modify the subject (*interval*) and do not affect subject-verb agreement.  

- **Correct (Sentence B):**  
  *The interval ... gives a stadia interval factor of 100.*  
- **Incorrect (Sentence A):**  
  *The interval ... give a stadia interval factor of 100.*  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Always identify the true subject of the sentence (here, *interval*) and ensure the verb matches its number (singular/plural)."

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both starting with ""For example, fringe theories in science depart significantly from mainstream science and..."" The difference is in the verb that follows: Sentence A uses ""have"" and Sentence B uses ""has"".

First, I need to identify the subject of the verb in question. The main clause here is ""fringe theories... depart... and have/has..."". The subject is ""fringe theories"", which is plural. The verbs ""depart"" and ""have/has"" are both part of the compound predicate connected by ""and"".

In Sentence A, ""have"" is the plural form of the verb, which matches the plural subject ""theories"". That makes sense. In Sentence B, ""has"" is singular, so it doesn't agree with the plural subject. That would be incorrect. 

Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. Could ""has"" be referring to something else? Let me check the structure again. The sentence structure is ""fringe theories... depart... and has..."". The verbs ""depart"" and ""has"" are both connected by ""and"", so they should both relate to the same subject. Since ""depart"" is plural, ""has"" should also be plural. Therefore, Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement. Sentence A is correct because ""have"" agrees with ""theories"".
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""fringe theories""** (plural). The verbs must agree with this plural subject:  
- **""depart""** (plural verb) and **""have""** (plural verb) in **Sentence A** are correct.  
- **""has""** (singular verb) in **Sentence B** incorrectly disagrees with the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:**  
Subject-verb agreement. Plural subjects require plural verbs (*have*), not singular verbs (*has*)."
13,have,has,4,"For example, fringe theories in science depart significantly from mainstream science and have little or no scientific support.","For example, fringe theories in science depart significantly from mainstream science and has little or no scientific support.",18,5737,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both talking about fringe theories in science. The difference between them is the verb used: ""has"" in sentence A and ""have"" in sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, the key here is to identify the subject that the verb is referring to.

Looking at both sentences, the main subject is ""fringe theories in science."" That's a plural subject because ""theories"" is plural. The verb that follows should agree with that. The sentence structure is: ""Fringe theories... depart... and [verb]..."" So both ""depart"" and the second verb need to agree with ""theories.""

In sentence A, the second verb is ""has."" ""Has"" is singular (third person singular present tense of ""have""). But since the subject is plural, ""theories,"" the correct verb should be ""have,"" which is plural. Therefore, sentence A uses ""has,"" which doesn't agree with the plural subject, making it ungrammatical.

Sentence B uses ""have,"" which is the correct plural form to match ""theories."" So sentence B is grammatical.

Wait, let me double-check. The structure is ""fringe theories depart... and have..."" So the verbs ""depart"" and ""have"" are both connected by ""and,"" meaning they both refer back to the same subject. Since ""theories"" is plural, both verbs need to be plural. ""Depart"" is correct (plural), and ""have"" is correct (plural). So yes, sentence B is correct. Sentence A incorrectly uses ""has,"" which is singular, so it's wrong.

I think that's it. The key is making sure both verbs agree with the plural subject. No other parts of the sentence seem to affect the subject-verb agreement here. So the answer is that sentence B is grammatical, and sentence A is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""fringe theories in science""** (plural). The verbs must agree with this plural subject:  
- **""Depart""** (plural) and **""have""** (plural) in **Sentence B** correctly match the plural subject.  
- **""Has""** in **Sentence A** is singular, creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

**Key Issue:**  
The error in Sentence A arises from the singular verb **""has""** incorrectly pairing with the plural subject **""theories.""** Sentence B fixes this by using the plural verb **""have.""**"
11,are,is,4,"Comments about the sex life or religious culture of another editor are simply unacceptable, i think.","Comments about the sex life or religious culture of another editor is simply unacceptable, i think.",16,5778,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Let me read them again carefully.

Sentence A: ""Comments about the sex life or religious culture of another editor are simply unacceptable, i think.""
Sentence B: ""Comments about the sex life or religious culture of another editor is simply unacceptable, i think.""

Hmm, the main difference between them is the verb: ""are"" in A and ""is"" in B. The subject here is ""Comments about the sex life or religious culture of another editor."" So, the key is subject-verb agreement. 

First, I need to determine if the subject is singular or plural. The noun at the core of the subject is ""Comments,"" which is plural. The rest of the phrase (""about...editor"") is a prepositional phrase modifying ""Comments."" Prepositional phrases don't affect the verb number. So, the verb should agree with ""Comments,"" which is plural. Therefore, the correct verb should be ""are,"" as in Sentence A. 

Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is singular. That would be incorrect because the subject is plural. So, Sentence B is ungrammatical. 

Wait, but sometimes when you have ""or"" in the subject, it can change things. Let me check. The subject here is ""Comments about the sex life or religious culture..."" The ""or"" is between two items in the prepositional phrase, not between two subjects. The main subject is still ""Comments,"" which is plural. So ""or"" here doesn't affect the verb number. 

Another thing to check: sometimes people confuse ""either...or"" constructions where the verb agrees with the closest noun. But in this case, it's just ""sex life or religious culture,"" both singular, but they are objects of the preposition ""about,"" so they don't influence the verb. The verb still needs to agree with ""Comments."" 

Also, the user wrote ""i think"" with a lowercase ""i."" That's a separate issue, but the question is about grammaticality regarding the verb. So, even though ""I"" should be capitalized, the main issue here is the subject-verb agreement. 

So, conclusion: Sentence A is correct because ""Comments"" is plural and takes ""are."" Sentence B is incorrect because it uses ""is,"" which is singular.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""Comments""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), violating subject-verb agreement.  

**Note:** Both sentences have a lowercase **""i""** in *""i think""*, which is grammatically incorrect (proper nouns like ""I"" must be capitalized). However, the primary focus here is on the subject-verb agreement."
11,are,is,4,"Comments about the sex life or religious culture of another editor are simply unacceptable, i think.","Comments about the sex life or religious culture of another editor is simply unacceptable, i think.",16,5778,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both talking about comments being unacceptable. The main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" in Sentence A and ""are"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, the key here is to figure out whether the subject of the sentence is singular or plural.

Looking at both sentences, the subject is ""Comments about the sex life or religious culture of another editor."" The main noun here is ""Comments,"" which is plural. The rest of the phrase (""about... editor"") is just providing more information about the comments, so it doesn't affect the number of the subject. 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""is,"" which is singular. That doesn't match with the plural subject ""Comments."" So that would be incorrect. Sentence B uses ""are,"" which is plural, matching the plural subject. That should be correct.

Wait, but sometimes when you have a compound subject connected by ""or,"" the verb agrees with the closer subject. For example, ""the pen or the pencils are..."" But in this case, the subject is ""Comments,"" which is plural, and the part after ""or"" is ""religious culture,"" which is singular. But actually, the structure here is ""Comments about [A or B]."" The ""or"" is between two items that the comments are about, not between two subjects. So the main subject is still ""Comments,"" plural. Therefore, the verb should be plural ""are.""

Another thing to check: sometimes people might confuse the subject if there's a prepositional phrase. But the subject is ""Comments,"" not the objects of the preposition ""about."" So the verb must agree with ""Comments.""

Also, the user wrote ""i think"" in lowercase. Both sentences have that, but that's a separate issue. The user is focusing on the verb agreement, so the main issue is ""is"" vs. ""are.""

So, Sentence A is incorrect because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject. Sentence B is correct because it uses ""are"" with the plural ""Comments.""
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""Comments"" (plural), so the verb must agree in number. ""Comments ... **are** simply unacceptable"" (plural verb) is correct. Sentence A incorrectly uses ""is"" (singular verb) with the plural subject ""Comments.""  

**Additional Notes:**  
- The phrase ""i think"" should also be capitalized (""I think"") in formal writing, but this error appears in both sentences and is unrelated to the core grammatical issue.  
- The structure ""sex life **or** religious culture"" does not affect subject-verb agreement here because ""or"" connects two singular nouns within a prepositional phrase modifying ""Comments."" The main subject (""Comments"") remains plural."
10,appear,appears,4,"Careers in law, business, education, and government appear to be common occupations for those that later decide to enter public office.","Careers in law, business, education, and government appears to be common occupations for those that later decide to enter public office.",21,5927,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both talking about careers in various fields being common occupations for people entering public office. The main difference between them is the verb: ""appear"" in Sentence A and ""appears"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to check subject-verb agreement. The subject here is ""Careers in law, business, education, and government."" Since ""careers"" is plural, the verb should agree with it. ""Appear"" is plural, and ""appears"" is singular. So, ""careers... appear"" would be correct. That would make Sentence A correct and Sentence B incorrect because it uses ""appears"" with a plural subject.

Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. Sometimes, even if the subject seems plural, if it's considered a single entity, the verb might be singular. But in this case, ""careers"" are multiple different fields, so they are definitely plural. So the verb should be ""appear.""

Another thing to check: the relative pronoun ""that"" is used for both sentences. The sentence says ""those that later decide..."" Typically, ""those who"" is preferred when referring to people. ""That"" is more for things. So maybe both sentences have an issue there. But the user is only asking about the verb agreement between A and B. So even if both have a problem with ""that,"" the main issue is the verb. So Sentence B is ungrammatical because of ""appears,"" and A is correct. But maybe the user isn't considering the ""that"" part. Let me confirm.

The question specifically asks which of the two is grammatical, focusing on the verb. So even if both have ""that,"" the key difference is ""appear"" vs. ""appears."" Therefore, Sentence A is correct, Sentence B is incorrect. The answer should point out the subject-verb agreement and maybe mention the ""that"" as an additional note, but the main issue is the verb.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The subject of the sentence is *""Careers in law, business, education, and government""* (plural), so the verb must agree with the plural subject.  
  - Sentence A correctly uses **""appear""** (plural verb).  
  - Sentence B incorrectly uses **""appears""** (singular verb), which does not match the plural subject.  

**Additional Note:**  
Both sentences use *""those that""* to refer to people. While this is colloquially acceptable, formal grammar prefers *""those who""* when referring to people (e.g., *""those who later decide...""*). However, this does not affect the grammaticality distinction between A and B, as the primary error in Sentence B is the verb agreement.  

**Conclusion:**  
Sentence A is correct. Sentence B is incorrect due to the mismatch between the plural subject and singular verb."
10,appear,appears,4,"Careers in law, business, education, and government appear to be common occupations for those that later decide to enter public office.","Careers in law, business, education, and government appears to be common occupations for those that later decide to enter public office.",21,5927,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Let me read them again carefully.

Sentence A: ""Careers in law, business, education, and government appears to be common occupations for those that later decide to enter public office.""

Sentence B: ""Careers in law, business, education, and government appear to be common occupations for those that later decide to enter public office.""

Hmm, the main difference between them is the verb: ""appears"" vs. ""appear"". The subject is ""Careers"", which is plural. So, the verb should agree with the subject. Since ""Careers"" is plural, the verb should be ""appear"" instead of ""appears"". So Sentence B uses ""appear"", which is correct, and Sentence A uses ""appears"", which is incorrect. That seems straightforward.

Wait, but let me check the rest of the sentences to make sure there aren't other issues. The second part of both sentences says ""for those that later decide to enter public office."" Hmm, ""those that"" – usually, when referring to people, it's more appropriate to use ""who"" instead of ""that"". So maybe both sentences have an issue there. But the user is specifically pointing out the difference between A and B, so maybe that's a secondary issue. The main problem is subject-verb agreement.

So, the primary error in Sentence A is the verb ""appears"" not agreeing with the plural subject ""Careers"". Sentence B corrects that by using ""appear"". Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical. 

But wait, let me think again. The subject is ""Careers"", which is plural, so yes, ""appear"" is correct. The other parts: ""common occupations"" – that's plural, which matches ""Careers"" as the subject. So ""appear to be common occupations"" is correct. 

Also, ""those that"" – ""those"" refers to people, so ""who"" would be better. But maybe in informal contexts, ""that"" is sometimes used. However, in formal grammar, ""who"" is preferred for people. So both sentences have that issue, but since the user is only asking about the grammaticality based on the given options, the main issue is the verb agreement. So Sentence A is ungrammatical because of ""appears"", and Sentence B is correct. 

Another thing to check: the phrase ""appear to be common occupations"" – does that make sense? Yes, because each career is an occupation, so multiple careers would be multiple occupations. So that part is okay. 

So, conclusion: Sentence B is grammatical, Sentence A is not. The key error is subject-verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement Error in Sentence A:**  
   - The subject of the sentence is **""Careers""** (plural), but the verb **""appears""** (singular) does not agree with it.  
   - Correction: Replace **""appears""** with **""appear""** (plural) to match the plural subject.  

2. **Correct Structure in Sentence B:**  
   - **""Careers ... appear""** correctly uses a plural verb to match the plural subject.  

### Additional Note:  
Both sentences contain a minor stylistic issue: **""those that""** is less standard when referring to people. In formal writing, **""those who""** is preferred (e.g., *""for those who later decide...""*). However, this does not affect grammaticality in most modern contexts.  

**Key Takeaway:** The critical grammatical error in Sentence A is the mismatch between the plural subject (**""Careers""**) and the singular verb (**""appears""**). Sentence B fixes this error."
11,include,includes,4,State agencies that provide relief for agriculture loss following a hurricane include north carolina department of agriculture and consumer services.,State agencies that provide relief for agriculture loss following a hurricane includes north carolina department of agriculture and consumer services.,20,6187,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about state agencies providing relief after a hurricane. The main difference between them is the verb: ""include"" in A and ""includes"" in B.

First, I need to identify the subject of the sentence. The subject here is ""State agencies,"" which is plural because ""agencies"" is plural. The verb should agree with the subject in number. So, plural subject takes a plural verb. ""Include"" is plural, and ""includes"" is singular. Therefore, sentence A uses ""include,"" which matches the plural subject, making it correct. Sentence B uses ""includes,"" which is singular and doesn't agree with the plural subject, so it's incorrect.

Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. Let me check again. The structure is ""State agencies... include/includes..."" The relative clause ""that provide relief..."" describes the agencies, but the main clause's subject is still ""State agencies."" So the verb must agree with ""agencies,"" not the object of the preposition or anything else. So yes, ""include"" is correct. 

Also, looking at the capitalization: ""north carolina department..."" should be capitalized as proper nouns. Both sentences have that lowercase, but the user's question is about grammaticality, which might include subject-verb agreement rather than capitalization. However, the user might not be considering that, so maybe focus on the verb first. But if they consider capitalization as part of grammar, then both have an issue. But the main issue here is the verb. So sentence A is correct in subject-verb agreement, B is incorrect. 

So the answer is that Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - The subject of the sentence is **""State agencies""** (plural).  
   - The verb must agree with the plural subject, so **""include""** (plural) is correct.  
   - Sentence B incorrectly uses **""includes""** (singular), which does not match the plural subject.  

2. **Capitalization Note**:  
   Both sentences have a minor error: **""north carolina department of agriculture and consumer services""** should be capitalized as a proper noun (e.g., **""North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services""**). However, this does not affect the core grammaticality distinction between A and B.  

**Key Takeaway**:  
Sentence A correctly uses **""include""** to agree with the plural subject **""State agencies""**, while Sentence B violates subject-verb agreement."
11,include,includes,4,State agencies that provide relief for agriculture loss following a hurricane include north carolina department of agriculture and consumer services.,State agencies that provide relief for agriculture loss following a hurricane includes north carolina department of agriculture and consumer services.,20,6187,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B. Both are about state agencies providing relief after a hurricane, specifically mentioning the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

First, I need to compare the two sentences. The main difference I notice is the verb: Sentence A uses ""includes"" and Sentence B uses ""include"". The subject in both cases is ""State agencies"", which is plural because ""agencies"" is plural. So, the verb should agree with the subject in number. 

In Sentence A, ""includes"" is singular. But the subject is plural, so that's a problem. The correct verb form for a plural subject should be ""include"", which is what Sentence B uses. Therefore, Sentence B is likely correct, and Sentence A is incorrect because of subject-verb disagreement.

Another thing to check is the capitalization of ""north carolina department..."". Proper nouns should be capitalized, so ""North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services"" should have each major word capitalized. Both sentences have it lowercase, which is incorrect, but since the user is focusing on grammaticality between the two, the main issue is the verb agreement. The capitalization might be a separate error, but the user is specifically asking about the grammaticality related to the verb.

So, the key point here is subject-verb agreement. ""State agencies"" (plural) require the plural verb ""include"", making Sentence B correct. Sentence A uses the singular ""includes"", which doesn't agree with the plural subject. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

### Explanation:  
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - The subject of the sentence is ""State agencies"" (plural).  
   - The verb must agree with the plural subject, so ""include"" (plural) is correct.  
   - Sentence A incorrectly uses ""includes"" (singular), which clashes with the plural subject.  

2. **Capitalization Error (both sentences)**:  
   - Proper nouns like ""North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services"" should be capitalized. This is an error in both sentences but does not affect the grammaticality distinction between A and B.  

**Corrected Version of Sentence B**:  
*State agencies that provide relief for agricultural loss following a hurricane include the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.*  

**Key Fixes**:  
- Changed ""include**s**"" → ""**include**"" (subject-verb agreement).  
- Added ""the"" before the department name (article required).  
- Capitalized proper nouns.  
- Changed ""agriculture loss"" → ""agricultural loss"" (adjective form)."
11,are,is,4,The large fireplaces in the west wall of the kitchen range are still very prominent.,The large fireplaces in the west wall of the kitchen range is still very prominent.,15,6231,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Let me read them again carefully.

Sentence A: ""The large fireplaces in the west wall of the kitchen range are still very prominent.""
Sentence B: ""The large fireplaces in the west wall of the kitchen range is still very prominent.""

Hmm, the main difference between them is the verb: ""are"" vs. ""is"". So, the subject here is ""The large fireplaces in the west wall of the kitchen range"". I need to figure out if the subject is plural or singular to determine which verb is correct.

First, let's break down the subject. The main noun is ""fireplaces"", which is plural. The other parts are prepositional phrases modifying ""fireplaces"": ""in the west wall"", ""of the kitchen range"". These don't affect the number of the subject. So the core subject is ""fireplaces"", which is plural. Therefore, the verb should agree with a plural subject. 

In Sentence A, the verb is ""are"", which is plural. That matches the plural subject ""fireplaces"". Sentence B uses ""is"", which is singular. That would be incorrect because the subject is plural. So Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb disagreement.

Wait, but maybe the user is confused because ""kitchen range"" might be considered as the subject? Let me check. The phrase ""in the west wall of the kitchen range"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""fireplaces"". The kitchen range is part of the location description, not the subject. The subject is definitely ""fireplaces"". So the verb must agree with ""fireplaces"", which is plural. Therefore, ""are"" is correct, and ""is"" is wrong. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes people might mistake the subject if there's a complex noun phrase. But in this case, the structure is clear. The main noun is ""fireplaces"", and all the other parts are just giving more details about where the fireplaces are located. So the verb should definitely be plural. 

Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""The large fireplaces""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb), creating a subject-verb disagreement.  

The prepositional phrases *""in the west wall of the kitchen range""* describe the fireplaces' location but do not affect the grammatical number of the subject."
11,are,is,4,The large fireplaces in the west wall of the kitchen range are still very prominent.,The large fireplaces in the west wall of the kitchen range is still very prominent.,15,6231,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Let me read them again carefully.

Sentence A: ""The large fireplaces in the west wall of the kitchen range is still very prominent.""
Sentence B: ""The large fireplaces in the west wall of the kitchen range are still very prominent.""

Hmm, the main difference between them is the verb: ""is"" vs. ""are"". So the subject here must be the key. Let's break down the sentence structure.

The subject of the sentence is ""The large fireplaces in the west wall of the kitchen range"". The verb needs to agree with the subject in number. The main noun in the subject is ""fireplaces"", which is plural. So the verb should be plural as well. ""Are"" is plural, and ""is"" is singular. Therefore, Sentence B uses ""are"", which matches the plural subject, so it should be correct. Sentence A uses ""is"", which is singular, so that would be incorrect.

Wait, but maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check if ""kitchen range"" is part of the subject. The phrase is ""in the west wall of the kitchen range"". So ""kitchen range"" is part of a prepositional phrase modifying ""west wall"", which is part of the location of the fireplaces. So the subject is still ""fireplaces"", which is plural. Therefore, the verb should be ""are"".

Another thing to consider: sometimes people get confused with intervening phrases. For example, if the sentence had ""The large fireplace in the west wall..."", then ""is"" would be correct. But here, ""fireplaces"" is plural, so ""are"" is needed. So Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect because of subject-verb agreement.

I think that's it. Let me just make sure there's no other possible subject. Could ""kitchen range"" be the subject? No, because ""kitchen range"" is part of the prepositional phrase ""of the kitchen range"", which is part of the description of the wall. The main subject is definitely ""fireplaces"". So yes, the verb must agree with ""fireplaces"", which is plural. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence B** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is **""The large fireplaces""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular verb) with the plural subject.  
- Sentence B correctly uses **""are""** (plural verb) to match the plural subject.  

The phrase **""in the west wall of the kitchen range""** is a prepositional phrase modifying ""fireplaces"" and does not affect subject-verb agreement. The error in Sentence A is a common mistake in subject-verb agreement when intervening phrases distract from the main subject."
12,follows,follow,4,"The traditional division of his plays into tragedies, comedies and histories follows the categories used in the first folio.","The traditional division of his plays into tragedies, comedies and histories follow the categories used in the first folio.",19,6389,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both talking about the traditional division of plays into categories. The main difference between them is the verb: ""follows"" in A and ""follow"" in B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of each sentence. The subject is crucial because the verb must agree with it in number. Let's look at Sentence A: ""The traditional division of his plays into tragedies, comedies and histories follows the categories..."" The main noun here is ""division,"" which is singular. The verb is ""follows,"" which is singular. So, subject-verb agreement seems correct here. 

Now, Sentence B: Same structure, but the verb is ""follow,"" which is plural. If the subject is still ""division,"" then ""follow"" would be incorrect because a singular subject needs a singular verb. But maybe someone could argue that the subject is different? Let me check again. The sentence starts with ""The traditional division..."" so ""division"" is definitely the subject. The prepositional phrases ""of his plays"" and ""into..."" just add more information but don't change the subject's number. 

Wait, could someone mistake the subject as ""plays"" because it's closer to the verb? For example, sometimes people get confused when there's a prepositional phrase between the subject and verb. But in this case, ""of his plays"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""division,"" so the subject remains ""division."" Therefore, the verb should be singular. 

So Sentence A uses ""follows"" (singular) with ""division"" (singular), which is correct. Sentence B uses ""follow"" (plural), which doesn't agree with the singular subject. Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and B is ungrammatical. 

I should also check if there's any other possible issue. Maybe the use of ""categories"" in the predicate. But ""follows the categories"" makes sense because the division is following the categories. So the meaning is clear. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes collective nouns can be tricky, but ""division"" here is a singular entity, so it definitely takes a singular verb. 

So, conclusion: Sentence A is correct, Sentence B is incorrect because of subject-verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of both sentences is **""The traditional division""** (singular). The verb must agree with the singular subject, so the correct form is **""follows""** (singular) in Sentence A.  

Sentence B incorrectly uses **""follow""** (plural), which does not match the singular subject. The intervening prepositional phrases (*""of his plays into tragedies, comedies, and histories""*) do not affect the grammatical number of the subject.  

Thus:  
- ✅ **Sentence A**: ""The traditional division ... **follows**..."" (correct).  
- ❌ **Sentence B**: ""The traditional division ... **follow**..."" (incorrect)."
12,follows,follow,4,"The traditional division of his plays into tragedies, comedies and histories follows the categories used in the first folio.","The traditional division of his plays into tragedies, comedies and histories follow the categories used in the first folio.",19,6389,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B, both talking about the traditional division of plays into categories. The main difference between them is the verb: ""follow"" in Sentence A and ""follows"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of each sentence. The subject is crucial because the verb must agree with it in number. Let's look at Sentence A: ""The traditional division of his plays into tragedies, comedies and histories follow the categories..."" The main noun here is ""division,"" which is singular. The phrase ""of his plays"" is a prepositional phrase modifying ""division,"" but it doesn't change the number of the subject. So the subject is singular, but the verb is ""follow,"" which is plural. That's a problem because a singular subject needs a singular verb. So ""follow"" should be ""follows."" Therefore, Sentence A is incorrect.

Now, Sentence B: ""The traditional division... follows the categories..."" Here, the verb is ""follows,"" which is singular. Since the subject ""division"" is singular, the verb agrees. So Sentence B is correct.

Wait, let me double-check. Sometimes people get confused with phrases that come after the subject, like ""of his plays,"" thinking that the noun in the prepositional phrase affects the verb. But no, the verb should always agree with the main subject, not the object of the preposition. So yes, ""division"" is singular, so ""follows"" is correct. Therefore, Sentence B is grammatical, and A is not.

Another way to test this is to simplify the sentence. Remove the prepositional phrases: ""The division follow..."" vs. ""The division follows..."" Clearly, ""follows"" is correct. So the answer is that Sentence B is grammatical, and A is ungrammatical because of subject-verb agreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""**The traditional division**,"" which is singular. The verb must agree with the singular subject, so it should be ""**follows**"" (singular) instead of ""**follow**"" (plural).  

- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses ""**follow**"" (plural verb) with the singular subject ""division,"" making it ungrammatical.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses ""**follows**"" (singular verb), ensuring subject-verb agreement.  

**Key Issue:**  
The error in Sentence A arises from misinterpreting the subject. Phrases like ""of his plays into tragedies, comedies, and histories"" do not affect the number of the subject (""division""), which remains singular."
14,rely,relies,4,"Other species, such as the mountain plover and the burrowing owl, also rely on prairie dog burrows for nesting areas.","Other species, such as the mountain plover and the burrowing owl, also relies on prairie dog burrows for nesting areas.",20,6496,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Both look almost the same except for the verb: ""rely"" in A and ""relies"" in B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of the verb. The main subject here is ""Other species."" Then there's a parenthetical part with examples: ""such as the mountain plover and the burrowing owl."" Parentheticals usually don't affect the verb agreement because they're just adding extra info. So the real subject is still ""Other species,"" which is plural. 

In sentence A, the verb is ""rely,"" which is plural. That matches the plural subject. In sentence B, the verb is ""relies,"" which is singular. That doesn't agree with the plural subject. So sentence B is incorrect because the subject and verb don't agree in number. 

Wait, but maybe someone could think that the examples after ""such as"" are the actual subject. But no, ""such as"" introduces examples that are part of the larger subject, but the main subject is still ""species."" So the verb should definitely be plural. 

Another way to check is to remove the parenthetical part. If you take out ""such as the mountain plover and the burrowing owl,"" the sentence becomes ""Other species also rely on..."" which clearly needs the plural verb. So sentence A is correct, and B is wrong because it uses the singular verb with a plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""Other species""** (plural).  
- The verb must agree in number with the subject. The plural verb **""rely""** (Sentence A) correctly matches the plural subject.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses the singular verb **""relies""**, which clashes with the plural subject.  

**Key Tip:**  
Phrases like **""such as...""** or **""along with...""** do not affect subject-verb agreement. Always identify the main subject first."
14,rely,relies,4,"Other species, such as the mountain plover and the burrowing owl, also rely on prairie dog burrows for nesting areas.","Other species, such as the mountain plover and the burrowing owl, also relies on prairie dog burrows for nesting areas.",20,6496,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are A and B. Both look pretty similar except for the verb: ""relies"" in A and ""rely"" in B.

First, I need to figure out the subject of each sentence. The main subject here is ""Other species."" Then there's a parenthetical part with examples: ""such as the mountain plover and the burrowing owl."" Parenthetical elements are usually set off by commas and don't affect the verb agreement. So the verb should agree with ""Other species,"" which is plural because ""species"" can be both singular and plural, but here it's ""other species,"" implying multiple species.

In sentence A, the verb is ""relies,"" which is singular. But the subject is plural, so that's a problem. Sentence B uses ""rely,"" which is plural, matching the plural subject. Therefore, sentence B is correct, and A is incorrect because of subject-verb disagreement.

Wait, let me double-check. Sometimes people get confused with ""such as"" phrases. The key is that the examples are just adding extra info, not changing the subject. So the verb should still agree with ""Other species."" Yep, so ""rely"" is correct. Sentence A is wrong because it uses the singular form. Got it.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is ""Other species,"" which is plural. The verb must agree with the plural subject, so the correct form is **""rely""** (Sentence B). Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb **""relies""**, which does not match the plural subject.  

The phrase ""such as the mountain plover and the burrowing owl"" is a parenthetical clause and does not affect subject-verb agreement. The verb should always correspond to the main subject, ""Other species."""
22,leave,leaves,4,"These facts, combined with the fact that inclement weather would've prevented anyone from entering or exiting the island, ultimately leave the investigators confounded.","These facts, combined with the fact that inclement weather would've prevented anyone from entering or exiting the island, ultimately leaves the investigators confounded.",23,7111,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which of these two sentences is grammatical. Let's look at Sentence A and Sentence B. Both start with ""These facts, combined with the fact that..."" and then talk about the weather preventing people from entering or exiting the island. The difference is in the verbs: Sentence A uses ""leave"" and Sentence B uses ""leaves"". 

First, I remember that subject-verb agreement is crucial. The subject here is ""These facts"", which is plural. The verb should agree with the subject. But wait, there's a complicating factor: the phrase ""combined with the fact..."" is added between commas. So, does that affect the subject?

I think when you have a subject followed by a phrase like ""combined with..."", the verb still agrees with the main subject, not the added part. So ""These facts"" is plural, so the verb should be plural. That would mean ""leave"" is correct in Sentence A, and ""leaves"" in Sentence B is wrong because it's singular. 

But let me double-check. Sometimes, phrases like ""as well as"", ""along with"", or ""combined with"" can make people confused about the subject. But grammatically, those phrases don't make the subject plural. For example, ""The dog, along with the cats, is..."" because the main subject is ""the dog"", singular. So applying that here, ""These facts"" is plural, so even with ""combined with..."", the verb should still be plural. Therefore, Sentence A is correct with ""leave"", and Sentence B is incorrect using ""leaves"". 

Wait, but let me think again. The structure is ""These facts, combined with..., ultimately leave..."" So the main clause is ""These facts... leave the investigators confounded."" The part between the commas is a parenthetical element, so it doesn't affect the number of the subject. So yes, ""These facts"" is the subject, plural, so ""leave"" is correct. Sentence B uses ""leaves"", which is singular, so that's a mistake. 

Therefore, Sentence A is grammatical, and Sentence B is ungrammatical because of the subject-verb agreement error.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is grammatical, while **Sentence B** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence is the plural noun phrase *""These facts""*. The intervening phrase *""combined with the fact...""* does not alter the grammatical number of the subject. Since the subject is plural, the verb must agree with it in number.  

- **Sentence A** correctly uses the plural verb *""leave""* to match *""These facts""*.  
- **Sentence B** incorrectly uses the singular verb *""leaves""*, creating a subject-verb agreement error.  

**Key Rule:**  
Phrases like *""combined with,""* *""along with,""* or *""as well as""* do not make a singular subject plural. The verb agrees with the main subject alone."
22,leave,leaves,4,"These facts, combined with the fact that inclement weather would've prevented anyone from entering or exiting the island, ultimately leave the investigators confounded.","These facts, combined with the fact that inclement weather would've prevented anyone from entering or exiting the island, ultimately leaves the investigators confounded.",23,7111,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this grammar question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences is grammatical: A or B. Both sentences are almost identical except for the verb ""leaves"" in A and ""leave"" in B. The main clause is about the subject agreeing with the verb. 

First, I need to identify the subject of the main clause. The sentence starts with ""These facts,"" which is plural. Then there's a parenthetical element: ""combined with the fact that..."" This part adds more information but doesn't change the subject's number. So, the main subject is still ""These facts,"" which is plural.

In sentence A, the verb is ""leaves,"" which is singular. That doesn't agree with the plural subject. In sentence B, the verb is ""leave,"" which is plural. That should be correct. But wait, sometimes when you have a phrase like ""combined with,"" people might get confused and think it's a compound subject. But actually, ""combined with"" is a prepositional phrase here, not part of the subject. So the verb should still agree with ""These facts,"" not the singular ""fact"" in the added phrase.

Let me double-check. If the sentence was ""These facts leave...,"" that's correct. Adding ""combined with..."" doesn't make the subject singular. So sentence B is correct, and A is wrong because of the singular verb. Yeah, that makes sense. Sometimes these intervening phrases can trick you into thinking the subject is different, but the key is to find the actual subject and make sure the verb matches.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the main clause is **""These facts""** (plural). The verb must agree in number with the subject, so the plural verb **""leave""** (Sentence B) is correct.  

In Sentence A, the singular verb **""leaves""** incorrectly matches the singular noun **""the fact""** in the intervening prepositional phrase (""combined with the fact...""), which is not the subject. The core structure is:  
*These facts [...] ultimately **leave** the investigators confounded.*  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Intervening phrases (like ""combined with the fact..."") do not affect subject-verb agreement. The verb must agree with the original subject (**""These facts""**)."
12,are,is,4,"Conventional values such as wealth, poverty, freedom, and slavery are all indifferent and produce no more pleasure than pain.","Conventional values such as wealth, poverty, freedom, and slavery is all indifferent and produce no more pleasure than pain.",19,7315,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about conventional values and their effects. 

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used after the subject. In Sentence A, the verb is ""are,"" and in Sentence B, it's ""is."" The rest of the sentence structure seems similar.

The subject here is ""Conventional values such as wealth, poverty, freedom, and slavery."" Since ""values"" is plural, the verb should agree with that. So, ""values"" is plural, so the verb should be plural as well. That would make ""are"" correct in Sentence A. Sentence B uses ""is,"" which is singular, so that's a subject-verb agreement error. 

Next, looking at the rest of the sentence: ""all indifferent and produce no more pleasure than pain."" The verb ""produce"" is in plural form, which matches the plural subject. If Sentence B had ""is,"" then the following verbs might not agree, but in this case, ""produce"" is correct for both because the subject is still plural. 

Wait, but in Sentence B, the verb after ""is"" is ""produce."" So the structure would be ""Conventional values... is all indifferent and produce..."" That's a problem because ""is"" is singular, but ""produce"" is plural. However, the main issue is the first verb. The subject ""values"" requires ""are,"" so Sentence A is correct, and B is incorrect because of ""is."" 

Another thing to check: sometimes with phrases like ""such as,"" the subject can be tricky, but here ""values"" is clearly the main subject, and the examples listed (wealth, poverty, etc.) are just additional information. So the verb must agree with ""values,"" not the examples. 

So, conclusion: Sentence A is grammatical because ""are"" agrees with the plural subject ""values."" Sentence B is ungrammatical because ""is"" doesn't agree with the plural subject.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence A** is **grammatical**, while **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""Conventional values""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
  - Sentence A correctly uses **""are""** (plural) to match the plural subject.  
  - Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular), creating a subject-verb agreement error.  

Additionally, in Sentence B, the mismatch continues with the plural verb **""produce""** later in the sentence, which clashes with the singular **""is""**. Sentence A maintains consistency throughout.  

**Key Issue:**  
- **Subject-verb agreement** is violated in Sentence B. Plural subjects require plural verbs (e.g., *values are*), not singular verbs (*values is*)."
12,are,is,4,"Conventional values such as wealth, poverty, freedom, and slavery are all indifferent and produce no more pleasure than pain.","Conventional values such as wealth, poverty, freedom, and slavery is all indifferent and produce no more pleasure than pain.",19,7315,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical and which isn't. The sentences are about conventional values like wealth, poverty, etc. 

First, I need to look at the structure of both sentences. The main difference between them is the verb used in the first part. Sentence A uses ""is"" while Sentence B uses ""are"". The rest of the sentence is the same: ""all indifferent and produce no more pleasure than pain.""

The subject here is ""Conventional values such as wealth, poverty, freedom, and slavery"". So, the subject is plural because ""values"" is plural, and the examples given (wealth, poverty, etc.) are all singular nouns but listed as part of the plural subject.

In English, the verb must agree with the subject in number. Since the subject is plural (""values""), the verb should also be plural. That means ""are"" is correct, and ""is"" is incorrect. 

Looking at Sentence A: ""Conventional values... is all indifferent..."" – here, ""is"" is singular, which doesn't match the plural subject. That's a subject-verb agreement error. 

Sentence B uses ""are"", which is plural, matching the subject. So Sentence B is correct. 

Then, checking the rest of the sentence for any other issues. The second verb is ""produce"". In Sentence A, after ""is"", we have ""produce"". But ""produce"" is plural, so if the first verb was ""is"", there might be an inconsistency. However, in Sentence B, ""are"" is followed by ""produce"", which is correct because the subject is still plural. 

Wait, but in both sentences, the structure is ""are all indifferent and produce..."". The conjunction ""and"" connects two verbs: ""are"" and ""produce"". Since the subject is plural, both verbs need to agree. In Sentence B, ""are"" and ""produce"" are both plural, so that's correct. In Sentence A, ""is"" is singular, but ""produce"" is plural, which creates inconsistency. However, the main error is the first verb ""is"" not agreeing with the plural subject. 

So the primary issue is the subject-verb agreement in the first part. Sentence A is incorrect because it uses ""is"" with a plural subject. Sentence B is correct because it uses ""are"". 

I don't see any other grammatical issues in the sentences. The rest of the structure seems okay. The phrase ""all indifferent"" is correct because ""indifferent"" is an adjective, and ""all"" here is an adverb meaning ""completely"" or ""wholly"". The comparison ""no more pleasure than pain"" is also correctly structured. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that Sentence B is grammatical, and Sentence A is ungrammatical due to the subject-verb disagreement.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence B** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence A** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
The subject of the sentence, *""Conventional values such as wealth, poverty, freedom, and slavery""*, is plural. Therefore, the verb must agree in number:  
- Sentence A incorrectly uses the singular verb **""is""** (*""values is""*), which violates subject-verb agreement.  
- Sentence B correctly uses the plural verb **""are""** (*""values are""*), matching the plural subject.  

The rest of the sentence structure (e.g., *""produce no more pleasure than pain""*) is grammatically consistent in both cases, but the error in Sentence A’s subject-verb agreement makes it ungrammatical."
14,are,is,4,"Various labeling techniques such as enzymatic labeling, protein labeling, and genetic labeling are widely utilized.","Various labeling techniques such as enzymatic labeling, protein labeling, and genetic labeling is widely utilized.",15,7317,order_1_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know which of the two sentences is grammatical. The sentences are A and B, both talking about labeling techniques. The main difference between them is the verb used: ""are"" in Sentence A and ""is"" in Sentence B.

First, I need to remember subject-verb agreement rules. The basic rule is that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. So, I should identify the subject in each sentence.

Looking at Sentence A: ""Various labeling techniques such as enzymatic labeling, protein labeling, and genetic labeling are widely utilized."" The subject here is ""Various labeling techniques."" The word ""various"" indicates plural, so the subject is plural. The verb is ""are,"" which is plural. That seems correct because plural subject takes plural verb.

Now, Sentence B: ""Various labeling techniques such as enzymatic labeling, protein labeling, and genetic labeling is widely utilized."" The subject is the same, ""Various labeling techniques,"" which is plural. But the verb here is ""is,"" which is singular. That doesn't match. So, the subject and verb don't agree in number here. That makes Sentence B incorrect.

Wait, but sometimes there can be confusion with phrases between the subject and verb. For example, if the subject is followed by a prepositional phrase or a list, people might mistakenly match the verb to the closest noun instead of the main subject. In both sentences, the main subject is ""techniques,"" which is plural. The part after ""such as"" is just giving examples, so it doesn't affect the verb. So the verb should still agree with ""techniques,"" which is plural. Therefore, ""are"" is correct, and ""is"" is wrong.

Another way to check is to simplify the sentence. Remove the examples: ""Various labeling techniques are widely utilized."" That's correct. If we use ""is,"" it becomes ""Various labeling techniques is widely utilized,"" which is clearly wrong. So Sentence A is correct, and B is incorrect.

I should also consider if there's any exception or special case here. For instance, sometimes collective nouns can be tricky, but ""techniques"" is a straightforward plural noun. There's no collective noun here. The verb must agree with the subject, not the items in the list. So yes, Sentence A is grammatical, and B is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
- **Sentence A** is **grammatical**.  
- **Sentence B** is **ungrammatical**.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of both sentences is **""Various labeling techniques""** (plural).  
- The verb must agree with the plural subject, so **""are""** (plural) is correct in Sentence A.  
- Sentence B incorrectly uses **""is""** (singular), which does not agree with the plural subject.  

**Key Grammar Rule:**  
- **Subject-verb agreement**: A plural subject requires a plural verb (e.g., ""techniques **are**""), while a singular subject requires a singular verb (e.g., ""a technique **is**"")."
14,are,is,4,"Various labeling techniques such as enzymatic labeling, protein labeling, and genetic labeling are widely utilized.","Various labeling techniques such as enzymatic labeling, protein labeling, and genetic labeling is widely utilized.",15,7317,order_2_response,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking which of the two sentences, A or B, is grammatical. The sentences are about labeling techniques. Let me read them again carefully.

Sentence A: ""Various labeling techniques such as enzymatic labeling, protein labeling, and genetic labeling is widely utilized.""

Sentence B: ""Various labeling techniques such as enzymatic labeling, protein labeling, and genetic labeling are widely utilized.""

Hmm, the main difference between the two is the verb: ""is"" in A and ""are"" in B. The subject here is ""Various labeling techniques..."" which is plural because ""various"" implies more than one. The verb needs to agree with the subject in number. 

So, the subject is ""techniques,"" which is plural. The verb should be plural as well. ""Are"" is the plural form of ""to be,"" so Sentence B uses ""are,"" which matches the plural subject. Sentence A uses ""is,"" which is singular, so that's incorrect. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused when there's a list after ""such as."" Let me check if the list affects the subject-verb agreement. The phrase ""such as enzymatic labeling, protein labeling, and genetic labeling"" is just giving examples of the various techniques. The main subject is still ""various labeling techniques,"" which is plural. So the verb should definitely be ""are."" 

Therefore, Sentence B is correct, and Sentence A is incorrect because it uses the singular ""is"" with a plural subject. The user might be confused because the list of examples comes right before the verb, making it easy to overlook the actual subject. But the key is to identify the main subject and ensure the verb agrees with it. 

Another thing to consider: ""is widely utilized"" vs. ""are widely utilized."" Since ""utilized"" is a past participle, the form of ""to be"" must agree with the subject. Plural subject needs plural verb. Yep, that's right. So Sentence B is grammatical, and A is not.
</think>

**Answer:**  
**Sentence B** is grammatical, while **Sentence A** is ungrammatical.  

**Explanation:**  
- The subject of the sentence is **""Various labeling techniques""** (plural), so the verb must agree in number.  
- **Sentence A** incorrectly uses the singular verb **""is""** with a plural subject.  
- **Sentence B** correctly uses the plural verb **""are""** to match the plural subject.  

**Key Issue:** Subject-verb agreement. Lists introduced by phrases like *""such as""* do not affect the number of the main subject."
